Yes,\nit deals with \"packages\" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-project\nbasis, installing them in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside your project. By\ndefault, it does not install anything globally. Thus, it is a dependency\nmanager. It does however support a \"global\" project for convenience via the\nglobal command.\nThis idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's\nnpm and ruby's bundler.\nSuppose:\n\nYou have a project that depends on a number of libraries.\nSome of those libraries depend on other libraries.\n\nComposer:\n\nEnables you to declare the libraries you depend on.\nFinds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed, and\ninstalls them (meaning it downloads them into your project).\nYou can update all your dependencies in one command.\n\nSee the Basic usage chapter for more details on declaring\ndependencies.\nSystem Requirements\nComposer requires PHP 5.3.2+ to run. A few sensitive php settings and compile\nflags are also required, but when using the installer you will be warned about\nany incompatibilities.\nTo install packages from sources instead of plain zip archives, you will need\ngit, svn, fossil or hg depending on how the package is version-controlled.\nComposer is multi-platform and we strive to make it run equally well on Windows,\nLinux and macOS.\nInstallation - Linux / Unix / macOS\nDownloading the Composer Executable\nComposer offers a convenient installer that you can execute directly from the\ncommand line. Feel free to download this file\nor review it on GitHub\nif you wish to know more about the inner workings of the installer. The source\nis plain PHP.\nThere are in short, two ways to install Composer. Locally as part of your\nproject, or globally as a system wide executable.\nLocally\nTo install Composer locally, run the installer in your project directory. See\nthe Download page for instructions.\nThe installer will check a few PHP settings and then download composer.phar\nto your working directory. This file is the Composer binary. It is a PHAR\n(PHP archive), which is an archive format for PHP which can be run on\nthe command line, amongst other things.\nNow run php composer.phar in order to run Composer.\nYou can install Composer to a specific directory by using the --install-dir\noption and additionally (re)name it as well using the --filename option. When\nrunning the installer when following\nthe Download page instructions add the\nfollowing parameters:\nphp composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer\n\nNow run php bin/composer in order to run Composer.\nGlobally\nYou can place the Composer PHAR anywhere you wish. If you put it in a directory\nthat is part of your PATH, you can access it globally. On Unix systems you\ncan even make it executable and invoke it without directly using the php\ninterpreter.\nAfter running the installer following the Download page instructions\nyou can run this to move composer.phar to a directory that is in your path:\nmv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer\n\nIf you like to install it only for your user and avoid requiring root permissions,\nyou can use ~/.local/bin instead which is available by default on some\nLinux distributions.\n\nNote: If the above fails due to permissions, you may need to run it again\nwith sudo.\nNote: On some versions of macOS the /usr directory does not exist by\ndefault. If you receive the error \"/usr/local/bin/composer: No such file or\ndirectory\" then you must create the directory manually before proceeding:\nmkdir -p /usr/local/bin.\nNote: For information on changing your PATH, please read the\nWikipedia article) and/or use\nyour search engine of choice.\n\nNow run composer in order to run Composer instead of php composer.phar.\nInstallation - Windows\nUsing the Installer\nThis is the easiest way to get Composer set up on your machine.\nDownload and run\nComposer-Setup.exe. It will\ninstall the latest Composer version and set up your PATH so that you can\ncall composer from any directory in your command line.\n\nNote: Close your current terminal. Test usage with a new terminal: This is\nimportant since the PATH only gets loaded when the terminal starts.\n\nManual Installation\nChange to a directory on your PATH and run the installer following\nthe Download page instructions\nto download composer.phar.\nCreate a new composer.bat file alongside composer.phar:\nUsing cmd.exe:\nC:\\bin> echo @php \"%~dp0composer.phar\" %*>composer.bat\n\nUsing PowerShell:\nPS C:\\bin> Set-Content composer.bat '@php \"%~dp0composer.phar\" %*'\n\nAdd the directory to your PATH environment variable if it isn't already.\nFor information on changing your PATH variable, please see\nthis article and/or\nuse your search engine of choice.\nClose your current terminal. Test usage with a new terminal:\nC:\\Users\\username>composer -V\nComposer version 1.0.0 2016-01-10 20:34:53\n\nUsing Composer\nNow that you've installed Composer, you are ready to use it! Head on over to the\nnext chapter for a short demonstration.\nBasic usage →\n"},"articles/aliases.html":{"url":"articles/aliases.html","title":"Aliases","keywords":"","body":"\nAliases\nWhy aliases?\nWhen you are using a VCS repository, you will only get comparable versions for\nbranches that look like versions, such as 2.0 or 2.0.x. For your master branch, you\nwill get a dev-master version. For your bugfix branch, you will get a\ndev-bugfix version.\nIf your master branch is used to tag releases of the 1.0 development line,\ni.e. 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, etc., any package depending on it will\nprobably require version 1.0.*.\nIf anyone wants to require the latest dev-master, they have a problem: Other\npackages may require 1.0.*, so requiring that dev version will lead to\nconflicts, since dev-master does not match the 1.0.* constraint.\nEnter aliases.\nBranch alias\nThe dev-master branch is one in your main VCS repo. It is rather common that\nsomeone will want the latest master dev version. Thus, Composer allows you to\nalias your dev-master branch to a 1.0.x-dev version. It is done by\nspecifying a branch-alias field under extra in composer.json:\n{\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"branch-alias\": {\n            \"dev-master\": \"1.0.x-dev\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf you alias a non-comparable version (such as dev-develop) dev- must prefix the\nbranch name. You may also alias a comparable version (i.e. start with numbers,\nand end with .x-dev), but only as a more specific version.\nFor example, 1.x-dev could be aliased as 1.2.x-dev.\nThe alias must be a comparable dev version, and the branch-alias must be present on\nthe branch that it references. For dev-master, you need to commit it on the\nmaster branch.\nAs a result, anyone can now require 1.0.* and it will happily install\ndev-master.\nIn order to use branch aliasing, you must own the repository of the package\nbeing aliased. If you want to alias a third party package without maintaining\na fork of it, use inline aliases as described below.\nRequire inline alias\nBranch aliases are great for aliasing main development lines. But in order to\nuse them you need to have control over the source repository, and you need to\ncommit changes to version control.\nThis is not really fun when you want to try a bugfix of some library that\nis a dependency of your local project.\nFor this reason, you can alias packages in your require and require-dev\nfields. Let's say you found a bug in the monolog/monolog package. You cloned\nMonolog on GitHub and fixed the issue in\na branch named bugfix. Now you want to install that version of monolog in your\nlocal project.\nYou are using symfony/monolog-bundle which requires monolog/monolog version\n1.*. So you need your dev-bugfix to match that constraint.\nAdd this to your project's root composer.json:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/you/monolog\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"symfony/monolog-bundle\": \"2.0\",\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"dev-bugfix as 1.0.x-dev\"\n    }\n}\n\nOr let composer add it for you with:\nphp composer.phar require monolog/monolog:\"dev-bugfix as 1.0.x-dev\"\nThat will fetch the dev-bugfix version of monolog/monolog from your GitHub\nand alias it to 1.0.x-dev.\n\nNote: Inline aliasing is a root-only feature. If a package with inline\naliases is required, the alias (right of the as) is used as the version\nconstraint. The part left of the as is discarded. As a consequence, if\nA requires B and B requires monolog/monolog version dev-bugfix as 1.0.x-dev,\ninstalling A will make B require 1.0.x-dev, which may exist as a branch\nalias or an actual 1.0 branch. If it does not, it must be\ninline-aliased again in A's composer.json.\nNote: Inline aliasing should be avoided, especially for published\npackages/libraries. If you found a bug, try to get your fix merged upstream.\nThis helps to avoid issues for users of your package.\n\n"},"articles/authentication-for-private-packages.html":{"url":"articles/authentication-for-private-packages.html","title":"Authentication For Private Packages","keywords":"","body":"\nAuthentication for privately hosted packages and repositories\nYour private package server or version control system is probably secured with one\nor more authentication options.

However, due to the way\nPSR-4 and PSR-0 autoloading rules are set up, it needs to check the filesystem\nbefore resolving a classname conclusively. This slows things down quite a bit,\nbut it is convenient in development environments because when you add a new class\nit can immediately be discovered/used without having to rebuild the autoloader\nconfiguration.\nThe problem however is in production you generally want things to happen as fast\nas possible, as you can rebuild the configuration every time you deploy and\nnew classes do not appear at random between deploys.\nFor this reason, Composer offers a few strategies to optimize the autoloader.\n\nNote: You should not enable any of these optimizations in development as\nthey all will cause various problems when adding/removing classes. The performance\ngains are not worth the trouble in a development setting.\n\nOptimization Level 1: Class map generation\nHow to run it?\nThere are a few options to enable this:\n\nSet \"optimize-autoloader\": true inside the config key of composer.json\nCall install or update with -o / --optimize-autoloader\nCall dump-autoload with -o / --optimize\n\nWhat does it do?\nClass map generation essentially converts PSR-4/PSR-0 rules into classmap rules.\nThis makes everything quite a bit faster as for known classes the class map\nreturns instantly the path, and Composer can guarantee the class is in there so\nthere is no filesystem check needed.\nOn PHP 5.6+, the class map is also cached in opcache which improves the initialization\ntime greatly. If you make sure opcache is enabled, then the class map should load\nalmost instantly and then class loading is fast.\nTrade-offs\nThere are no real trade-offs with this method. It should always be enabled in\nproduction.\nThe only issue is it does not keep track of autoload misses (i.e. when\nit cannot find a given class), so those fallback to PSR-4 rules and can still\nresult in slow filesystem checks. To solve this issue two Level 2 optimization\noptions exist, and you can decide to enable either if you have a lot of\nclass_exists checks that are done for classes that do not exist in your project.\nOptimization Level 2/A: Authoritative class maps\nHow to run it?\nThere are a few options to enable this:\n\nSet \"classmap-authoritative\": true inside the config key of composer.json\nCall install or update with -a / --classmap-authoritative\nCall dump-autoload with -a / --classmap-authoritative\n\nWhat does it do?\nEnabling this automatically enables Level 1 class map optimizations.\nThis option says that if something is not found in the classmap,\nthen it does not exist and the autoloader should not attempt to look on the\nfilesystem according to PSR-4 rules.\nTrade-offs\nThis option makes the autoloader always return very quickly. On the flipside it\nalso means that in case a class is generated at runtime for some reason, it will\nnot be allowed to be autoloaded. If your project or any of your dependencies does that\nthen you might experience \"class not found\" issues in production. Enable this with care.\n\nNote: This cannot be combined with Level 2/B optimizations. You have to choose one as\nthey address the same issue in different ways.\n\nOptimization Level 2/B: APCu cache\nHow to run it?\nThere are a few options to enable this:\n\nSet \"apcu-autoloader\": true inside the config key of composer.json\nCall install or update with --apcu-autoloader\nCall dump-autoload with --apcu\n\nWhat does it do?\nThis option adds an APCu cache as a fallback for the class map. It will not\nautomatically generate the class map though, so you should still enable Level 1\noptimizations manually if you so desire.\nWhether a class is found or not, that fact is always cached in APCu, so it can be\nreturned quickly on the next request.\nTrade-offs\nThis option requires APCu which may or may not be available to you. It also\nuses APCu memory for autoloading purposes, but it is safe to use and cannot\nresult in classes not being found like the authoritative class map\noptimization above.\n\nNote: This cannot be combined with Level 2/A optimizations. You have to choose one as\nthey address the same issue in different ways.\n\n"},"articles/custom-installers.html":{"url":"articles/custom-installers.html","title":"Custom Installers","keywords":"","body":"\nSetting up and using custom installers\nSynopsis\nAt times, it may be necessary for a package to require additional actions during\ninstallation, such as installing packages outside of the default vendor\nlibrary.\nIn these cases you could consider creating a Custom Installer to handle your\nspecific logic.\nCalling a Custom Installer\nSuppose that your project already has a Custom Installer for specific modules\nthen invoking that installer is a matter of defining the correct type in\nyour package file.\n\nSee the next chapter for an instruction how to create Custom Installers.\n\nEvery Custom Installer defines which type string it will recognize. Once\nrecognized it will completely override the default installer and only apply its\nown logic.\nAn example use-case would be:\n\nphpDocumentor features Templates that need to be installed outside of the\ndefault /vendor folder structure. As such they have chosen to adopt the\nphpdocumentor-template type and create a plugin providing the Custom\nInstaller to send these templates to the correct folder.\n\nAn example composer.json of such a template package would be:\n{\n    \"name\": \"phpdocumentor/template-responsive\",\n    \"type\": \"phpdocumentor-template\",\n    \"require\": {\n        \"phpdocumentor/template-installer-plugin\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nIMPORTANT: to make sure that the template installer is present at the\ntime the template package is installed, template packages should require\nthe plugin package.\n\nCreating an Installer\nA Custom Installer is defined as a class that implements the\nComposer\\Installer\\InstallerInterface and is usually distributed in a\nComposer Plugin.\nA basic Installer Plugin would thus compose of three files:\n\nthe package file: composer.json\nThe Plugin class, e.g.: My\\Project\\Composer\\Plugin.php, containing a class that implements Composer\\Plugin\\PluginInterface.\nThe Installer class, e.g.: My\\Project\\Composer\\Installer.php, containing a class that implements Composer\\Installer\\InstallerInterface.\n\ncomposer.json\nThe package file is the same as any other package file but with the following\nrequirements:\n\nthe type attribute must be composer-plugin.\nthe extra attribute must contain an element class defining the\nclass name of the plugin (including namespace). If a package contains\nmultiple plugins this can be array of class names.\n\nExample:\n{\n    \"name\": \"phpdocumentor/template-installer-plugin\",\n    \"type\": \"composer-plugin\",\n    \"license\": \"MIT\",\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": {\"phpDocumentor\\\\Composer\": \"src/\"}\n    },\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"class\": \"phpDocumentor\\\\Composer\\\\TemplateInstallerPlugin\"\n    },\n    \"require\": {\n        \"composer-plugin-api\": \"^1.0\"\n    },\n    \"require-dev\": {\n        \"composer/composer\": \"^1.3\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe example above has Composer itself in its require-dev, which allows you to use\nthe Composer classes in your test suite for example.\nThe Plugin class\nThe class defining the Composer plugin must implement the\nComposer\\Plugin\\PluginInterface. It can then register the Custom\nInstaller in its activate() method.\nThe class may be placed in any location and have any name, as long as it is\nautoloadable and matches the extra.class element in the package definition.\nExample:\ngetInstallationManager()->addInstaller($installer);\n    }\n}\n\nThe Custom Installer class\nThe class that executes the custom installation should implement the\nComposer\\Installer\\InstallerInterface (or extend another installer that\nimplements that interface). It defines the type string as it will be\nrecognized by packages that will use this installer in the supports() method.\n\nNOTE: choose your type name carefully, it is recommended to follow\nthe format: vendor-type. For example: phpdocumentor-template.\n\nThe InstallerInterface class defines the following methods (please see the\nsource for the exact signature):\n\nsupports(), here you test whether the passed type matches the name\nthat you declared for this installer (see the example).\nisInstalled(), determines whether a supported package is installed or not.\ninstall(), here you can determine the actions that need to be executed\nupon installation.\nupdate(), here you define the behavior that is required when Composer is\ninvoked with the update argument.\nuninstall(), here you can determine the actions that need to be executed\nwhen the package needs to be removed.\ngetInstallPath(), this method should return the location where the\npackage is to be installed, relative from the location of composer.json.\nThe path must not end with a slash.\n\nExample:\ngetPrettyName(), 0, 23);\n        if ('phpdocumentor/template-' !== $prefix) {\n            throw new \\InvalidArgumentException(\n                'Unable to install template, phpdocumentor templates '\n                .'should always start their package name with '\n                .'\"phpdocumentor/template-\"'\n            );\n        }\n\n        return 'data/templates/'.substr($package->getPrettyName(), 23);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * {@inheritDoc}\n     */\n    public function supports($packageType)\n    {\n        return 'phpdocumentor-template' === $packageType;\n    }\n}\n\nThe example demonstrates that it is possible to extend the\nComposer\\Installer\\LibraryInstaller class to strip a prefix\n(phpdocumentor/template-) and use the remaining part to assemble a completely\ndifferent installation path.\n\nInstead of being installed in /vendor any package installed using this\nInstaller will be put in the /data/templates/ folder.\n\n"},"articles/handling-private-packages.html":{"url":"articles/handling-private-packages.html","title":"Handling Private Packages","keywords":"","body":"\nHandling private packages\nPrivate Packagist\nPrivate Packagist is a commercial package hosting product\noffering professional support and web based management of private and public packages,\nand granular access permissions.

Then it\nuses \"require-all\": true which selects all versions of all packages in the\nrepositories you defined.\nThe default file Satis looks for is satis.json in the root of the repository.\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Repository\",\n  \"homepage\": \"http://packages.example.org\",\n  \"repositories\": [\n    { \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/mycompany/privaterepo\" },\n    { \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"http://svn.example.org/private/repo\" },\n    { \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/mycompany/privaterepo2\" }\n  ],\n  \"require-all\": true\n}\n\nIf you want to cherry pick which packages you want, you can list all the\npackages you want to have in your satis repository inside the classic composer\nrequire key, using a \"*\" constraint to make sure all versions are selected,\nor another constraint if you want really specific versions.\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    { \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/mycompany/privaterepo\" },\n    { \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"http://svn.example.org/private/repo\" },\n    { \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/mycompany/privaterepo2\" }\n  ],\n  \"require\": {\n    \"company/package\": \"*\",\n    \"company/package2\": \"*\",\n    \"company/package3\": \"2.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n\nOnce you've done this, you run:\nphp bin/satis build  \nWhen you ironed out that process, what you would typically do is run this\ncommand as a cron job on a server. It would then update all your package info\nmuch like Packagist does.\nNote that if your private packages are hosted on GitHub, your server should\nhave an ssh key that gives it access to those packages, and then you should add\nthe --no-interaction (or -n) flag to the command to make sure it falls back\nto ssh key authentication instead of prompting for a password. This is also a\ngood trick for continuous integration servers.\nSet up a virtual-host that points to that web/ directory, let's say it is\npackages.example.org. Alternatively, with PHP >= 5.4.0, you can use the\nbuilt-in CLI server php -S localhost:port -t satis-output-dir/ for a\ntemporary solution.\nPartial Updates\nYou can tell Satis to selectively update only particular packages or process\nonly a repository with a given URL. This cuts down the time it takes to rebuild\nthe package.json file and is helpful if you use (custom) webhooks to trigger\nrebuilds whenever code is pushed into one of your repositories.\nTo rebuild only particular packages, pass the package names on the command line\nlike so:\nphp bin/satis build satis.json web/ this/package that/other-package\nNote that this will still need to pull and scan all of your VCS repositories\nbecause any VCS repository might contain (on any branch) one of the selected\npackages.\nIf you want to scan only the selected package and not all VCS repositories you need\nto declare a name for all your package (this only work on VCS repositories type) :\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    { \"name\": \"company/privaterepo\", \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/mycompany/privaterepo\" },\n    { \"name\": \"private/repo\", \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"http://svn.example.org/private/repo\" },\n    { \"name\": \"mycompany/privaterepo2\", \"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/mycompany/privaterepo2\" }\n  ]\n}\n\nIf you want to scan only a single repository and update all packages found in\nit, pass the VCS repository URL as an optional argument:\nphp bin/satis build --repository-url https://only.my/repo.git satis.json web/\nUsage\nIn your projects all you need to add now is your own composer repository using\nthe packages.example.org as URL, then you can require your private packages\nand everything should work smoothly. You don't need to copy all your\nrepositories in every project anymore. Only that one unique repository that\nwill update itself.\n{\n  \"repositories\": [ { \"type\": \"composer\", \"url\": \"http://packages.example.org/\" } ],\n  \"require\": {\n    \"company/package\": \"1.2.0\",\n    \"company/package2\": \"1.5.2\",\n    \"company/package3\": \"dev-master\"\n  }\n}\n\nSecurity\nTo secure your private repository you can host it over SSH or SSL using a client\ncertificate. In your project you can use the options parameter to specify the\nconnection options for the server.\nExample using a custom repository using SSH (requires the SSH2 PECL extension):\n{\n  \"repositories\": [{\n    \"type\": \"composer\",\n    \"url\": \"ssh2.sftp://example.org\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"ssh2\": {\n        \"username\": \"composer\",\n        \"pubkey_file\": \"/home/composer/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\",\n        \"privkey_file\": \"/home/composer/.ssh/id_rsa\"\n      }\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\n\nTip: See ssh2 context options for more information.\n\nExample using SSL/TLS (HTTPS) using a client certificate:\n{\n  \"repositories\": [{\n     \"type\": \"composer\",\n     \"url\": \"https://example.org\",\n     \"options\": {\n       \"ssl\": {\n         \"local_cert\": \"/home/composer/.ssl/composer.pem\"\n       }\n     }\n  }]\n}\n\n\nTip: See ssl context options for more information.\n\nExample using a custom HTTP Header field for token authentication:\n{\n  \"repositories\": [{\n    \"type\": \"composer\",\n    \"url\": \"https://example.org\",\n    \"options\":  {\n      \"http\": {\n        \"header\": [\n          \"API-TOKEN: YOUR-API-TOKEN\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\nAuthentication\nAuthentication can be handled in several different ways.\nDownloads\nWhen GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repositories are mirrored on your local satis, the\nbuild process will include the location of the downloads these platforms make\navailable. This means that the repository and your setup depend on the\navailability of these services.\nAt the same time, this implies that all code which is hosted somewhere else (on\nanother service or for example in Subversion) will not have downloads available\nand thus installations usually take a lot longer.\nTo enable your satis installation to create downloads for all (Git, Mercurial\nand Subversion) your packages, add the following to your satis.json:\n{\n  \"archive\": {\n    \"directory\": \"dist\",\n    \"format\": \"tar\",\n    \"prefix-url\": \"https://amazing.cdn.example.org\",\n    \"skip-dev\": true\n  }\n}\n\nOptions explained\n\ndirectory: required, the location of the dist files (inside the\noutput-dir)\nformat: optional, zip (default) or tar\nprefix-url: optional, location of the downloads, homepage (from\nsatis.json) followed by directory by default\nskip-dev: optional, false by default, when enabled (true) satis will\nnot create downloads for branches\nabsolute-directory: optional, a local directory where the dist files are\ndumped instead of output-dir/directory\nwhitelist: optional, if set as a list of package names, satis will only\ndump the dist files of these packages\nblacklist: optional, if set as a list of package names, satis will not\ndump the dist files of these packages\nchecksum: optional, true by default, when disabled (false) satis will\nnot provide the sha1 checksum for the dist files\n\nOnce enabled, all downloads (include those from GitHub and BitBucket) will be\nreplaced with a local version.\nprefix-url\nPrefixing the URL with another host is especially helpful if the downloads end\nup in a private Amazon S3 bucket or on a CDN host. A CDN would drastically\nimprove download times and therefore package installation.\nExample: A prefix-url of https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com (and\ndirectory set to dist) creates download URLs which look like the following:\nhttps://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/dist/vendor-package-version-ref.zip.\nWeb outputs\n\noutput-html: optional, true by default, when disabled (false) satis\nwill not generate the output-dir/index.html page.\ntwig-template: optional, a path to a personalized Twig template for\nthe output-dir/index.html page.\n\nAbandoned packages\nTo enable your satis installation to indicate that some packages are abandoned,\nadd the following to your satis.json:\n{\n  \"abandoned\": {\n    \"company/package\": true,\n    \"company/package2\": \"company/newpackage\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe true value indicates that the package is truly abandoned while the\n\"company/newpackage\" value specifies that the package is replaced by the\ncompany/newpackage package.\nNote that all packages set as abandoned in their own composer.json file will\nbe marked abandoned as well.\nResolving dependencies\nIt is possible to make satis automatically resolve and add all dependencies for\nyour projects. This can be used with the Downloads functionality to have a\ncomplete local mirror of packages. Add the following to your satis.json:\n{\n  \"require-dependencies\": true,\n  \"require-dev-dependencies\": true\n}\n\nWhen searching for packages, satis will attempt to resolve all the required\npackages from the listed repositories.  Therefore, if you are requiring a\npackage from Packagist, you will need to define it in your satis.json.\nDev dependencies are packaged only if the require-dev-dependencies parameter\nis set to true.\nOther options\n\nproviders: optional, false by default, when enabled (true) each\npackage will be dumped into a separate include file which will be only\nloaded by composer when the package is really required. Speeds up composer\nhandling for repositories with huge number of packages like f.i. packagist.\noutput-dir: optional, defines where to output the repository files if not\nprovided as an argument when calling the build command.\nconfig: optional, lets you define all config options from composer, except\narchive-format and archive-dir as the configuration is done through\narchive instead. See docs on config schema for more details.\nnotify-batch: optional, specify a URL that will be called every time a\nuser installs a package. See notify-batch.\n\n"},"articles/plugins.html":{"url":"articles/plugins.html","title":"Plugins","keywords":"","body":"\nSetting up and using plugins\nSynopsis\nYou may wish to alter or expand Composer's functionality with your own. For\nexample if your environment poses special requirements on the behaviour of\nComposer which do not apply to the majority of its users or if you wish to\naccomplish something with Composer in a way that is not desired by most users.\nIn these cases you could consider creating a plugin to handle your\nspecific logic.\nCreating a Plugin\nA plugin is a regular Composer package which ships its code as part of the\npackage and may also depend on further packages.\nPlugin Package\nThe package file is the same as any other package file but with the following\nrequirements:\n\nThe type attribute must be composer-plugin.\nThe extra attribute must contain an element class defining the\nclass name of the plugin (including namespace). If a package contains\nmultiple plugins, this can be array of class names.\nYou must require the special package called composer-plugin-api\nto define which Plugin API versions your plugin is compatible with.\nRequiring this package doesn't actually include any extra dependencies,\nit only specifies which version of the plugin API to use.\n\n\nNote: When developing a plugin, although not required, it's useful to add\na require-dev dependency on composer/composer to have IDE auto completion on Composer classes.\n\nThe required version of the composer-plugin-api follows the same rules\nas a normal package's.\nThe current Composer plugin API version is 2.0.0.\nAn example of a valid plugin composer.json file (with the autoloading\npart omitted and an optional require-dev dependency on composer/composer for IDE auto completion):\n{\n    \"name\": \"my/plugin-package\",\n    \"type\": \"composer-plugin\",\n    \"require\": {\n        \"composer-plugin-api\": \"^2.0\"\n    },\n    \"require-dev\": {\n        \"composer/composer\": \"^2.0\"\n    },\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"class\": \"My\\\\Plugin\"\n    }\n}\n\nPlugin Class\nEvery plugin has to supply a class which implements the\nComposer\\Plugin\\PluginInterface. The activate() method of the plugin\nis called after the plugin is loaded and receives an instance of\nComposer\\Composer as well as an instance of\nComposer\\IO\\IOInterface. Using these two objects all configuration can\nbe read and all internal objects and state can be manipulated as desired.\nExample:\ngetInstallationManager()->addInstaller($installer);\n    }\n}\n\nEvent Handler\nFurthermore plugins may implement the\nComposer\\EventDispatcher\\EventSubscriberInterface in order to have its\nevent handlers automatically registered with the EventDispatcher when the\nplugin is loaded.\nTo register a method to an event, implement the method getSubscribedEvents()\nand have it return an array. The array key must be the\nevent name\nand the value is the name of the method in this class to be called.\n\nNote: If you don't know which event to listen to, you can run a Composer\ncommand with the COMPOSER_DEBUG_EVENTS=1 environment variable set, which might\nhelp you identify what event you are looking for.\n\npublic static function getSubscribedEvents()\n{\n    return array(\n        'post-autoload-dump' => 'methodToBeCalled',\n        // ^ event name ^         ^ method name ^\n    );\n}\n\nBy default, the priority of an event handler is set to 0. The priority can be\nchanged by attaching a tuple where the first value is the method name, as\nbefore, and the second value is an integer representing the priority.\nHigher integers represent higher priorities. Priority 2 is called before\npriority 1, etc.\npublic static function getSubscribedEvents()\n{\n    return array(\n        // Will be called before events with priority 0\n        'post-autoload-dump' => array('methodToBeCalled', 1)\n    );\n}\n\nIf multiple methods should be called, then an array of tuples can be attached\nto each event. The tuples do not need to include the priority. If it is\nomitted, it will default to 0.\npublic static function getSubscribedEvents()\n{\n    return array(\n        'post-autoload-dump' => array(\n            array('methodToBeCalled'      ), // Priority defaults to 0\n            array('someOtherMethodName', 1), // This fires first\n        )\n    );\n}\n\nHere's a complete example:\ncomposer = $composer;\n        $this->io = $io;\n    }\n\n    public function deactivate(Composer $composer, IOInterface $io)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function uninstall(Composer $composer, IOInterface $io)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public static function getSubscribedEvents()\n    {\n        return array(\n            PluginEvents::PRE_FILE_DOWNLOAD => array(\n                array('onPreFileDownload', 0)\n            ),\n        );\n    }\n\n    public function onPreFileDownload(PreFileDownloadEvent $event)\n    {\n        $protocol = parse_url($event->getProcessedUrl(), PHP_URL_SCHEME);\n\n        if ($protocol === 's3') {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nPlugin capabilities\nComposer defines a standard set of capabilities which may be implemented by plugins.\nTheir goal is to make the plugin ecosystem more stable as it reduces the need to mess\nwith Composer\\Composer's internal state, by providing explicit extension points\nfor common plugin requirements.\nCapable Plugins classes must implement the Composer\\Plugin\\Capable interface\nand declare their capabilities in the getCapabilities() method.\nThis method must return an array, with the key as a Composer Capability class name,\nand the value as the Plugin's own implementation class name of said Capability:\n 'My\\Composer\\CommandProvider',\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nCommand provider\nThe Composer\\Plugin\\Capability\\CommandProvider capability allows to register\nadditional commands for Composer:\nsetName('custom-plugin-command');\n    }\n\n    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n    {\n        $output->writeln('Executing');\n    }\n}\n\nNow the custom-plugin-command is available alongside Composer commands.\n\nComposer commands are based on the Symfony Console Component.\n\nRunning plugins manually\nPlugins for an event can be run manually by the run-script command. This works the same way as\nrunning scripts manually.\nUsing Plugins\nPlugin packages are automatically loaded as soon as they are installed and will\nbe loaded when Composer starts up if they are found in the current project's\nlist of installed packages. Additionally all plugin packages installed in the\nCOMPOSER_HOME directory using the Composer global command are loaded before\nlocal project plugins are loaded.\n\nYou may pass the --no-plugins option to Composer commands to disable all\ninstalled plugins. This may be particularly helpful if any of the plugins\ncauses errors and you wish to update or uninstall it.\n\nPlugin Helpers\nAs of Composer 2, due to the fact that DownloaderInterface can sometimes return Promises\nand have been split up in more steps than they used to, we provide a SyncHelper\nto make downloading and installing packages easier.\nPlugin Extra Attributes\nA few special plugin capabilities can be unlocked using extra attributes in the plugin's composer.json.\nclass\nSee above for an explanation of the class attribute and how it works.\nplugin-modifies-downloads\nSome special plugins need to update package download URLs before they get downloaded.\nAs of Composer 2.0, all packages are downloaded before they get installed. This means\non the first installation, your plugin is not yet installed when the download occurs,\nand it does not get a chance to update the URLs on time.\nSpecifying {\"extra\": {\"plugin-modifies-downloads\": true}} in your composer.json will\nhint to Composer that the plugin should be installed on its own before proceeding with\nthe rest of the package downloads. This slightly slows down the overall installation\nprocess however, so do not use it in plugins which do not absolutely require it.\n"},"articles/repository-priorities.html":{"url":"articles/repository-priorities.html","title":"Repository Priorities","keywords":"","body":"\nRepository priorities\nCanonical repositories\nWhen Composer resolves dependencies, it will look up a given package in the\ntopmost repository. If that repository does not contain the package, it\ngoes on to the next one, until one repository contains it and the process ends.\nCanonical repositories are better for a few reasons:\n\nPerformance wise, it is more efficient to stop looking for a package once it\nhas been found somewhere. It also avoids loading duplicate packages in case\nthe same package is present in several of your repositories.\nSecurity wise, it is safer to treat them canonically as it means that packages you\nexpect to come from your most important repositories will never be loaded from \nanother repository instead. Let's\nsay you have a private repository which is not canonical, and you require your\nprivate package foo/bar ^2.0 for example. Now if someone publishes\nfoo/bar 2.999 to packagist.org, suddenly Composer will pick that package as it\nhas a higher version than your latest release (say 2.4.3), and you end up installing\nsomething you may not have meant to. If the private repository is canonical\nhowever, that 2.999 version from packagist.org will not be considered at all.\n\nThere are however a few cases where you may want to specifically load some packages\nfrom a given repository, but not all. Or you may want a given repository to not be\ncanonical, and to be only preferred if it has higher package versions than the\nrepositories defined below.\nDefault behavior\nBy default in Composer 2.x all repositories are canonical. Composer 1.x treated\nall repositories as non-canonical.\nAnother default is that the packagist.org repository is always added implicitly\nas the last repository, unless you disable it.\nMaking repositories non-canonical\nYou can add the canonical option to any repository to disable this default behavior\nand make sure Composer keeps looking in other repositories, even if that repository\ncontains a given package.\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"composer\",\n            \"url\": \"https://example.org\",\n            \"canonical\": false\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFiltering packages\nYou can also filter packages which a repository will be able to load, either by\nselecting which ones you want, or by excluding those you do not want.\nFor example here we want to pick only the package foo/bar and all the packages from\nsome-vendor/ from this composer repository.\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"composer\",\n            \"url\": \"https://example.org\",\n            \"only\": [\"foo/bar\", \"some-vendor/*\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nAnd in this other example we exclude toy/package from a repository, which\nwe may not want to load in this project.\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"composer\",\n            \"url\": \"https://example.org\",\n            \"exclude\": [\"toy/package\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nBoth only and exclude should be arrays of package names, which can also\ncontain wildcards (*) which will match any characters.\n"},"articles/resolving-merge-conflicts.html":{"url":"articles/resolving-merge-conflicts.html","title":"Resolving Merge Conflicts","keywords":"","body":"\nResolving merge conflicts\nWhen working as a team on the same Composer project, you will eventually run into a scenario\nwhere multiple people added, updated or removed something in the composer.json and\ncomposer.lock files in multiple branches. When those branches are eventually merged\ntogether, you will get merge conflicts. Resolving these merge conflicts is not as straight\nforward as on other files, especially not regarding the composer.lock file.\n\nNote: It might not immediately be obvious why text based merging is not possible for\nlock files, so let's imagine the following example where we want to merge two branches;\n\nBranch 1 has added package A which requires package B. Package B is locked at version 1.0.0.\nBranch 2 has added package C which conflicts with all versions below 1.2.0 of package B.\n\nA text based merge would result in package A version 1.0.0, package B version 1.0.0\nand package C version 1.0.0. This is an invalid result, as the conflict of package C\nwas not considered and would require an upgrade of package B.\n\n1. Reapplying changes\nThe safest method to merge Composer files is to accept the version from one branch and apply\nthe changes from the other branch.\nAn example where we have two branches:\n\nPackage 'A' has been added\nPackage 'B' has been removed and package 'C' is added.\n\nTo resolve the conflict when we merge these two branches:\n\nWe choose the branch that has the most changes, and accept the composer.json and composer.lock\nfiles from that branch. In this case, we choose the composer files from branch 2.\nWe reapply the changes from the other branch (branch 1). In this case we have to run\ncomposer require package/A again.\n\n2. Validating your merged files\nBefore committing, make sure the resulting composer.json and composer.lock files are valid.\nTo do this, run the following commands:\ncomposer validate\ncomposer install [--dry-run]\n\nImportant considerations\nKeep in mind that whenever merge conflicts occur on the lock file, the information about the exact version\nnew packages were locked on for one of the branches gets lost. When package A in branch 1 is constrained\nas ^1.2.0 and locked as 1.2.0, it might get updated when branch 2 is used as baseline and a new\ncomposer require package/A:^1.2.0 is executed, as that will use the most recent version that the\nconstraint allows when possible. There might be a version 1.3.0 for that package available by now, which\nwill now be used instead.\nChoosing the correct version constraints and making sure the packages adhere\nto semantic versioning when using\nnext significant release operators should make sure\nthat merging branches does not break anything by accidentally updating a dependency.\n"},"articles/scripts.html":{"url":"articles/scripts.html","title":"Scripts","keywords":"","body":"\nScripts\nWhat is a script?\nA script, in Composer's terms, can either be a PHP callback (defined as a\nstatic method) or any command-line executable command. Scripts are useful\nfor executing a package's custom code or package-specific commands during\nthe Composer execution process.\n\nNote: Only scripts defined in the root package's composer.json are\nexecuted. If a dependency of the root package specifies its own scripts,\nComposer does not execute those additional scripts.\n\nEvent names\nComposer fires the following named events during its execution process:\nCommand Events\n\npre-install-cmd: occurs before the install command is executed with a\nlock file present.\npost-install-cmd: occurs after the install command has been executed\nwith a lock file present.\npre-update-cmd: occurs before the update command is executed, or before\nthe install command is executed without a lock file present.\npost-update-cmd: occurs after the update command has been executed, or\nafter the install command has been executed without a lock file present.\npre-status-cmd: occurs before the status command is executed.\npost-status-cmd: occurs after the status command has been executed.\npre-archive-cmd: occurs before the archive command is executed.\npost-archive-cmd: occurs after the archive command has been executed.\npre-autoload-dump: occurs before the autoloader is dumped, either during\ninstall/update, or via the dump-autoload command.\npost-autoload-dump: occurs after the autoloader has been dumped, either\nduring install/update, or via the dump-autoload command.\npost-root-package-install: occurs after the root package has been\ninstalled during the create-project command (but before its\ndependencies are installed).\npost-create-project-cmd: occurs after the create-project command has\nbeen executed.\n\nInstaller Events\n\npre-operations-exec: occurs before the install/upgrade/.. operations\nare executed when installing a lock file.\n\nPackage Events\n\npre-package-install: occurs before a package is installed.\npost-package-install: occurs after a package has been installed.\npre-package-update: occurs before a package is updated.\npost-package-update: occurs after a package has been updated.\npre-package-uninstall: occurs before a package is uninstalled.\npost-package-uninstall: occurs after a package has been uninstalled.\n\nPlugin Events\n\ninit: occurs after a Composer instance is done being initialized.\ncommand: occurs before any Composer Command is executed on the CLI. It\nprovides you with access to the input and output objects of the program.\npre-file-download: occurs before files are downloaded and allows\nyou to manipulate the HttpDownloader object prior to downloading files\nbased on the URL to be downloaded.\npost-file-download: occurs after package dist files are downloaded and\nallows you to perform additional checks on the file if required.\npre-command-run: occurs before a command is executed and allows you to\nmanipulate the InputInterface object's options and arguments to tweak\na command's behavior.\npre-pool-create: occurs before the Pool of packages is created, and lets\nyou filter the list of packages which is going to enter the Solver.\n\n\nNote: Composer makes no assumptions about the state of your dependencies\nprior to install or update. Therefore, you should not specify scripts\nthat require Composer-managed dependencies in the pre-update-cmd or\npre-install-cmd event hooks. If you need to execute scripts prior to\ninstall or update please make sure they are self-contained within your\nroot package.\n\nDefining scripts\nThe root JSON object in composer.json should have a property called\n\"scripts\", which contains pairs of named events and each event's\ncorresponding scripts. An event's scripts can be defined as either a string\n(only for a single script) or an array (for single or multiple scripts.)\nFor any given event:\n\nScripts execute in the order defined when their corresponding event is fired.\nAn array of scripts wired to a single event can contain both PHP callbacks\nand command-line executable commands.\nPHP classes containing defined callbacks must be autoloadable via Composer's\nautoload functionality.\nCallbacks can only autoload classes from psr-0, psr-4 and classmap\ndefinitions. If a defined callback relies on functions defined outside of a\nclass, the callback itself is responsible for loading the file containing these\nfunctions.\n\nScript definition example:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"post-update-cmd\": \"MyVendor\\\\MyClass::postUpdate\",\n        \"post-package-install\": [\n            \"MyVendor\\\\MyClass::postPackageInstall\"\n        ],\n        \"post-install-cmd\": [\n            \"MyVendor\\\\MyClass::warmCache\",\n            \"phpunit -c app/\"\n        ],\n        \"post-autoload-dump\": [\n            \"MyVendor\\\\MyClass::postAutoloadDump\"\n        ],\n        \"post-create-project-cmd\": [\n            \"php -r \\\"copy('config/local-example.php', 'config/local.php');\\\"\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nUsing the previous definition example, here's the class MyVendor\\MyClass\nthat might be used to execute the PHP callbacks:\ngetComposer();\n        // do stuff\n    }\n\n    public static function postAutoloadDump(Event $event)\n    {\n        $vendorDir = $event->getComposer()->getConfig()->get('vendor-dir');\n        require $vendorDir . '/autoload.php';\n\n        some_function_from_an_autoloaded_file();\n    }\n\n    public static function postPackageInstall(PackageEvent $event)\n    {\n        $installedPackage = $event->getOperation()->getPackage();\n        // do stuff\n    }\n\n    public static function warmCache(Event $event)\n    {\n        // make cache toasty\n    }\n}\n\nNote: During a Composer install or update command run, a variable named\nCOMPOSER_DEV_MODE will be added to the environment. If the command was run\nwith the --no-dev flag, this variable will be set to 0, otherwise it will be\nset to 1. The variable is also available while dump-autoload runs, and it\nwill be set to same as the last install or update was run in.\nEvent classes\nWhen an event is fired, your PHP callback receives as first argument a\nComposer\\EventDispatcher\\Event object. This object has a getName() method\nthat lets you retrieve the event name.\nDepending on the script types you will get various event\nsubclasses containing various getters with relevant data and associated\nobjects:\n\nBase class: Composer\\EventDispatcher\\Event\nCommand Events: Composer\\Script\\Event\nInstaller Events: Composer\\Installer\\InstallerEvent\nPackage Events: Composer\\Installer\\PackageEvent\nPlugin Events:\ninit: Composer\\EventDispatcher\\Event\ncommand: Composer\\Plugin\\CommandEvent\npre-file-download: Composer\\Plugin\\PreFileDownloadEvent\npost-file-download: Composer\\Plugin\\PostFileDownloadEvent\n\n\n\nRunning scripts manually\nIf you would like to run the scripts for an event manually, the syntax is:\ncomposer run-script [--dev] [--no-dev] script\n\nFor example composer run-script post-install-cmd will run any\npost-install-cmd scripts and plugins that have been defined.\nYou can also give additional arguments to the script handler by appending --\nfollowed by the handler arguments. e.g.\ncomposer run-script post-install-cmd -- --check will pass--check along to\nthe script handler. Those arguments are received as CLI arg by CLI handlers,\nand can be retrieved as an array via $event->getArguments() by PHP handlers.\nWriting custom commands\nIf you add custom scripts that do not fit one of the predefined event name\nabove, you can either run them with run-script or also run them as native\nComposer commands. For example the handler defined below is executable by\nrunning composer test:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"phpunit\"\n    }\n}\n\nSimilar to the run-script command you can give additional arguments to scripts,\ne.g. composer test -- --filter  will pass --filter  along\nto the phpunit script.\n\nNote: Before executing scripts, Composer's bin-dir is temporarily pushed\non top of the PATH environment variable so that binaries of dependencies\nare directly accessible. In this example no matter if the phpunit binary is\nactually in vendor/bin/phpunit or bin/phpunit it will be found and executed.\n\nAlthough Composer is not intended to manage long-running processes and other\nsuch aspects of PHP projects, it can sometimes be handy to disable the process\ntimeout on custom commands. This timeout defaults to 300 seconds and can be\noverridden in a variety of ways depending on the desired effect:\n\ndisable it for all commands using the config key process-timeout,\ndisable it for the current or future invocations of composer using the\nenvironment variable COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT,\nfor a specific invocation using the --timeout flag of the run-script command,\nusing a static helper for specific scripts.\n\nTo disable the timeout for specific scripts with the static helper directly in\ncomposer.json:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": [\n            \"Composer\\\\Config::disableProcessTimeout\",\n            \"phpunit\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nTo disable the timeout for every script on a given project, you can use the\ncomposer.json configuration:\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"process-timeout\": 0\n    }\n}\n\nIt's also possible to set the global environment variable to disable the timeout\nof all following scripts in the current terminal environment:\nexport COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=0\nTo disable the timeout of a single script call, you must use the run-script composer\ncommand and specify the --timeout parameter:\ncomposer run-script --timeout=0 test\nReferencing scripts\nTo enable script re-use and avoid duplicates, you can call a script from another\none by prefixing the command name with @:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": [\n            \"@clearCache\",\n            \"phpunit\"\n        ],\n        \"clearCache\": \"rm -rf cache/*\"\n    }\n}\n\nYou can also refer a script and pass it new arguments:\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"tests\": \"phpunit\",\n    \"testsVerbose\": \"@tests -vvv\"\n  }\n}\n\nCalling Composer commands\nTo call Composer commands, you can use @composer which will automatically\nresolve to whatever composer.phar is currently being used:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": [\n            \"@composer install\",\n            \"phpunit\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nOne limitation of this is that you can not call multiple composer commands in\na row like @composer install && @composer foo. You must split them up in a\nJSON array of commands.\nExecuting PHP scripts\nTo execute PHP scripts, you can use @php which will automatically\nresolve to whatever php process is currently being used:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": [\n            \"@php script.php\",\n            \"phpunit\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nOne limitation of this is that you can not call multiple commands in\na row like @php install && @php foo. You must split them up in a\nJSON array of commands.\nYou can also call a shell/bash script, which will have the path to\nthe PHP executable available in it as a PHP_BINARY env var.\nSetting environment variables\nTo set an environment variable in a cross-platform way, you can use @putenv:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"install-phpstan\": [\n            \"@putenv COMPOSER=phpstan-composer.json\",\n            \"composer install --prefer-dist\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nCustom descriptions.\nYou can set custom script descriptions with the following in your composer.json:\n{\n    \"scripts-descriptions\": {\n        \"test\": \"Run all tests!\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe descriptions are used in composer list or composer run -l commands to\ndescribe what the scripts do when the command is run.\n\nNote: You can only set custom descriptions of custom commands.\n\n"},"articles/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"articles/troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"\nTroubleshooting\nThis is a list of common pitfalls on using Composer, and how to avoid them.\nGeneral\n\nBefore asking anyone, run composer diagnose to check\nfor common problems. If it all checks out, proceed to the next steps.\n\nWhen facing any kind of problems using Composer, be sure to work with the\nlatest version. See self-update for details.\n\nMake sure you have no problems with your setup by running the installer's\nchecks via curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --check.\n\nEnsure you're installing vendors straight from your composer.json via\nrm -rf vendor && composer update -v when troubleshooting, excluding any\npossible interferences with existing vendor installations or composer.lock\nentries.\n\nTry clearing Composer's cache by running composer clear-cache.\n\n\nPackage not found\n\nDouble-check you don't have typos in your composer.json or repository\nbranches and tag names.\n\nBe sure to set the right\nminimum-stability. To get started or be\nsure this is no issue, set minimum-stability to \"dev\".\n\nPackages not coming from Packagist should\nalways be defined in the root package (the package depending on all\nvendors).\n\nUse the same vendor and package name throughout all branches and tags of\nyour repository, especially when maintaining a third party fork and using\nreplace.\n\nIf you are updating to a recently published version of a package, be aware that\nPackagist has a delay of up to 1 minute before new packages are visible to Composer.\n\nIf you are updating a single package, it may depend on newer versions itself.\nIn this case add the --with-dependencies argument or add all dependencies which\nneed an update to the command.\n\n\nPackage not found on travis-ci.org\n\nCheck the \"Package not found\" item above.\n\nIf the package tested is a dependency of one of its dependencies (cyclic\ndependency), the problem might be that Composer is not able to detect the version\nof the package properly. If it is a git clone it is generally alright and Composer\nwill detect the version of the current branch, but travis does shallow clones so\nthat process can fail when testing pull requests and feature branches in general.\nThe best solution is to define the version you are on via an environment variable\ncalled COMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION. You set it to dev-master for example to define\nthe root package's version as dev-master.\nUse: before_script: COMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION=dev-master composer install to export\nthe variable for the call to composer.\n\n\nPackage not found in a Jenkins-build\n\nCheck the \"Package not found\" item above.\nReason for failing is similar to the problem which can occur on travis-ci.org: The\ngit-clone / checkout within Jenkins leaves the branch in a \"detached HEAD\"-state. As\na result, Composer is not able to identify the version of the current checked out branch\nand may not be able to resolve a cyclic dependency. To solve this problem, you can use\nthe \"Additional Behaviours\" -> \"Check out to specific local branch\" in your Git-settings\nfor your Jenkins-job, where your \"local branch\" shall be the same branch as you are\nchecking out. Using this, the checkout will not be in detached state any more and cyclic\ndependency is recognized correctly.\n\nI have a dependency which contains a \"repositories\" definition in its composer.json, but it seems to be ignored.\nThe repositories configuration property is defined as root-only. It is not inherited. You can read more about the reasons behind this in the \"why can't\ncomposer load repositories recursively?\" article.\nThe simplest work-around to this limitation, is moving or duplicating the repositories definition into your root\ncomposer.json.\nI have locked a dependency to a specific commit but get unexpected results.\nWhile Composer supports locking dependencies to a specific commit using the #commit-ref syntax, there are certain\ncaveats that one should take into account. The most important one is documented, but\nfrequently overlooked:\n\nNote: While this is convenient at times, it should not be how you use\npackages in the long term because it comes with a technical limitation. The\ncomposer.json metadata will still be read from the branch name you specify\nbefore the hash. Because of that in some cases it will not be a practical\nworkaround, and you should always try to switch to tagged releases as soon\nas you can.\n\nThere is no simple work-around to this limitation. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do not use it.\nNeed to override a package version\nLet's say your project depends on package A, which in turn depends on a specific\nversion of package B (say 0.1). But you need a different version of said package B (say 0.11).\nYou can fix this by aliasing version 0.11 to 0.1:\ncomposer.json:\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"A\": \"0.2\",\n        \"B\": \"0.11 as 0.1\"\n    }\n}\n\nSee aliases for more information.\nMemory limit errors\nComposer may sometimes fail on some commands with this message:\nPHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of XXXXXX bytes exhausted \nIn this case, the PHP memory_limit should be increased.\n\nNote: Composer internally increases the memory_limit to 1.5G.\n\nTo get the current memory_limit value, run:\nphp -r \"echo ini_get('memory_limit').PHP_EOL;\"\n\nTry increasing the limit in your php.ini file (ex. /etc/php5/cli/php.ini for\nDebian-like systems):\n; Use -1 for unlimited or define an explicit value like 2G\nmemory_limit = -1\n\nComposer also respects a memory limit defined by the COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT environment variable:\nCOMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer.phar \n\nOr, you can increase the limit with a command-line argument:\nphp -d memory_limit=-1 composer.phar \n\nThis issue can also happen on cPanel instances, when the shell fork bomb protection is activated. For more information, see the documentation of the fork bomb feature on the cPanel site.\nXdebug impact on Composer\nTo improve performance when the Xdebug extension is enabled, Composer automatically restarts PHP without it.\nYou can override this behavior by using an environment variable: COMPOSER_ALLOW_XDEBUG=1.\nComposer will always show a warning if Xdebug is being used, but you can override this with an environment variable:\nCOMPOSER_DISABLE_XDEBUG_WARN=1. If you see this warning unexpectedly, then the restart process has failed:\nplease report this issue.\n\"The system cannot find the path specified\" (Windows)\n\nOpen regedit.\nSearch for an AutoRun key inside HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor,\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\nor HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Command Processor.\nCheck if it contains any path to non-existent file, if it's the case, remove them.\n\nAPI rate limit and OAuth tokens\nBecause of GitHub's rate limits on their API it can happen that Composer prompts\nfor authentication asking your username and password so it can go ahead with its work.\nIf you would prefer not to provide your GitHub credentials to Composer you can\nmanually create a token using the procedure documented here.\nNow Composer should install/update without asking for authentication.\nproc_open(): fork failed errors\nIf composer shows proc_open() fork failed on some commands:\nPHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'ErrorException' with message 'proc_open(): fork failed - Cannot allocate memory' in phar\nThis could be happening because the VPS runs out of memory and has no Swap space enabled.\nfree -m\n\ntotal used free shared buffers cached\nMem: 2048 357 1690 0 0 237\n-/+ buffers/cache: 119 1928\nSwap: 0 0 0\n\nTo enable the swap you can use for example:\n/bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap.1 bs=1M count=1024\n/sbin/mkswap /var/swap.1\n/bin/chmod 0600 /var/swap.1\n/sbin/swapon /var/swap.1\n\nYou can make a permanent swap file following this tutorial.\nproc_open(): failed to open stream errors (Windows)\nIf composer shows proc_open(NUL) errors on Windows:\nproc_open(NUL): failed to open stream: No such file or directory\nThis could be happening because you are working in a OneDrive directory and\nusing a version of PHP that does not support the file system semantics of this\nservice. The issue was fixed in PHP 7.2.23 and 7.3.10.\nAlternatively it could be because the Windows Null Service is not enabled. For\nmore information, see this issue.\nDegraded Mode\nDue to some intermittent issues on Travis and other systems, we introduced a\ndegraded network mode which helps Composer finish successfully but disables\na few optimizations. This is enabled automatically when an issue is first\ndetected. If you see this issue sporadically you probably don't have to worry\n(a slow or overloaded network can also cause those time outs), but if it\nappears repeatedly you might want to look at the options below to identify\nand resolve it.\nIf you have been pointed to this page, you want to check a few things:\n\nIf you are using ESET antivirus, go in \"Advanced Settings\" and disable \"HTTP-scanner\"\nunder \"web access protection\"\nIf you are using IPv6, try disabling it. If that solves your issues, get in touch\nwith your ISP or server host, the problem is not at the Packagist level but in the\nrouting rules between you and Packagist (i.e. the internet at large). The best way to get\nthese fixed is raise awareness to the network engineers that have the power to fix it.\nTake a look at the next section for IPv6 workarounds.\n\nIf none of the above helped, please report the error.\n\n\nOperation timed out (IPv6 issues)\nYou may run into errors if IPv6 is not configured correctly. A common error is:\nThe \"https://getcomposer.org/version\" file could not be downloaded: failed to\nopen stream: Operation timed out\nWe recommend you fix your IPv6 setup. If that is not possible, you can try the\nfollowing workarounds:\nWorkaround Linux:\nOn linux, it seems that running this command helps to make ipv4 traffic have a\nhigher prio than ipv6, which is a better alternative than disabling ipv6 entirely:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100' >> /etc/gai.conf\"\n\nWorkaround Windows:\nOn windows the only way is to disable ipv6 entirely I am afraid (either in windows or in your home router).\nWorkaround Mac OS X:\nGet name of your network device:\nnetworksetup -listallnetworkservices\n\nDisable IPv6 on that device (in this case \"Wi-Fi\"):\nnetworksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi\n\nRun composer ...\nYou can enable IPv6 again with:\nnetworksetup -setv6automatic Wi-Fi\n\nThat said, if this fixes your problem, please talk to your ISP about it to\ntry and resolve the routing errors. That's the best way to get things resolved\nfor everyone.\nComposer hangs with SSH ControlMaster\nWhen you try to install packages from a Git repository and you use the ControlMaster\nsetting for your SSH connection, Composer might hang endlessly and you see a sh\nprocess in the defunct state in your process list.\nThe reason for this is a SSH Bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1988\nAs a workaround, open a SSH connection to your Git host before running Composer:\nssh -t git@mygitserver.tld\ncomposer update\n\nSee also https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/4180 for more information.\nZip archives are not unpacked correctly.\nComposer can unpack zipballs using either a system-provided unzip utility or PHP's\nnative ZipArchive class. The ZipArchive class is preferred on Windows. On other\nOSes where ZIP files can contain permissions and symlinks, the unzip utility is\npreferred. You're advised to install it if you need these features.\n"},"articles/vendor-binaries.html":{"url":"articles/vendor-binaries.html","title":"Vendor Binaries","keywords":"","body":"\nVendor binaries and the vendor/bin directory\nWhat is a vendor binary?\nAny command line script that a Composer package would like to pass along\nto a user who installs the package should be listed as a vendor binary.\nIf a package contains other scripts that are not needed by the package\nusers (like build or compile scripts) that code should not be listed\nas a vendor binary.\nHow is it defined?\nIt is defined by adding the bin key to a project's composer.json.\nIt is specified as an array of files so multiple binaries can be added\nfor any given project.\n{\n    \"bin\": [\"bin/my-script\", \"bin/my-other-script\"]\n}\n\nWhat does defining a vendor binary in composer.json do?\nIt instructs Composer to install the package's binaries to vendor/bin\nfor any project that depends on that project.\nThis is a convenient way to expose useful scripts that would\notherwise be hidden deep in the vendor/ directory.\nWhat happens when Composer is run on a composer.json that defines vendor binaries?\nFor the binaries that a package defines directly, nothing happens.\nWhat happens when Composer is run on a composer.json that has dependencies with vendor binaries listed?\nComposer looks for the binaries defined in all of the dependencies.

In the sense of a\nversion control system, a \"version\" is a specific set of files that contain\nspecific data. In git terminology, this is a \"ref\", or a specific commit,\nwhich may be represented by a branch HEAD or a tag. When you check out that\nversion in your VCS -- for example, tag v1.1 or commit e35fa0d --, you're\nasking for a single, known set of files, and you always get the same files back.\nIn Composer, what's often referred to casually as a version -- that is,\nthe string that follows the package name in a require line (e.g., ~1.1 or\n1.2.*) -- is actually more specifically a version constraint. Composer\nuses version constraints to figure out which refs in a VCS it should be\nchecking out (or to verify that a given library is acceptable in\nthe case of a statically-maintained library with a version specification\nin composer.json).\nVCS Tags and Branches\nFor the following discussion, let's assume the following sample library\nrepository:\n~/my-library$ git branch\nv1\nv2\nmy-feature\nanother-feature\n\n~/my-library$ git tag\nv1.0\nv1.0.1\nv1.0.2\nv1.1-BETA\nv1.1-RC1\nv1.1-RC2\nv1.1\nv1.1.1\nv2.0-BETA\nv2.0-RC1\nv2.0\nv2.0.1\nv2.0.2\n\nTags\nNormally, Composer deals with tags (as opposed to branches -- if you don't\nknow what this means, read up on\nversion control systems).\nWhen you write a version constraint, it may reference a specific tag (e.g.,\n1.1) or it may reference a valid range of tags (e.g., >=1.1 , or\n~4.0). To resolve these constraints, Composer first asks the VCS to list\nall available tags, then creates an internal list of available versions based\non these tags. In the above example, composer's internal list includes versions\n1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, the beta release of 1.1, the first and second\nrelease candidates of 1.1, the final release version 1.1, etc.... (Note\nthat Composer automatically removes the 'v' prefix in the actual tagname to\nget a valid final version number.)\nWhen Composer has a complete list of available versions from your VCS, it then\nfinds the highest version that matches all version constraints in your project\n(it's possible that other packages require more specific versions of the\nlibrary than you do, so the version it chooses may not always be the highest\navailable version) and it downloads a zip archive of that tag to unpack in the\ncorrect location in your vendor directory.\nBranches\nIf you want Composer to check out a branch instead of a tag, you need to point it to the branch using the special dev-* prefix (or sometimes suffix; see below). If you're checking out a branch, it's assumed that you want to work on the branch and Composer actually clones the repo into the correct place in your vendor directory. For tags, it copies the right files without actually cloning the repo. (You can modify this behavior with --prefer-source and --prefer-dist, see install options.)\nIn the above example, if you wanted to check out the my-feature branch, you would specify dev-my-feature as the version constraint in your require clause. This would result in Composer cloning the my-library repository into my vendor directory and checking out the my-feature branch.\nWhen branch names look like versions, we have to clarify for composer that we're trying to check out a branch and not a tag. In the above example, we have two version branches: v1 and v2. To get Composer to check out one of these branches, you must specify a version constraint that looks like this: v1.x-dev. The .x is an arbitrary string that Composer requires to tell it that we're talking about the v1 branch and not a v1 tag (alternatively, you can name the branch v1.x instead of v1). In the case of a branch with a version-like name (v1, in this case), you append -dev as a suffix, rather than using dev- as a prefix.\nStabilities\nComposer recognizes the following stabilities (in order of stability): dev,\nalpha, beta, RC, and stable where RC stands for release candidate. The stability\nof a version is defined by its suffix e.g version v1.1-BETA has a stability of\nbeta and v1.1-RC1 has a stability of RC. If such a suffix is missing\ne.g. version v1.1 then Composer considers that version stable. In addition\nto that Composer automatically adds a -dev suffix to all numeric branches and\nprefixes all other branches imported from a VCS repository with dev-. In both\ncases the stability dev gets assigned.\nKeeping this in mind will help you in the next section.\nMinimum Stability\nThere's one more thing that will affect which files are checked out of a library's VCS and added to your project: Composer allows you to specify stability constraints to limit which tags are considered valid. In the above example, note that the library released a beta and two release candidates for version 1.1 before the final official release. To receive these versions when running composer install or composer update, we have to explicitly tell Composer that we are ok with release candidates and beta releases (and alpha releases, if we want those). This can be done using either a project-wide minimum-stability value in composer.json or using \"stability flags\" in version constraints. Read more on the schema page.\nWriting Version Constraints\nNow that you have an idea of how Composer sees versions, let's talk about how\nto specify version constraints for your project dependencies.\nExact Version Constraint\nYou can specify the exact version of a package. This will tell Composer to\ninstall this version and this version only. If other dependencies require\na different version, the solver will ultimately fail and abort any install\nor update procedures.\nExample: 1.0.2\nVersion Range\nBy using comparison operators you can specify ranges of valid versions. Valid\noperators are >, >=, , , !=.\nYou can define multiple ranges. Ranges separated by a space ( )\nor comma (,) will be treated as a logical AND. A double pipe (||)\nwill be treated as a logical OR. AND has higher precedence than OR.\n\nNote: Be careful when using unbounded ranges as you might end up\nunexpectedly installing versions that break backwards compatibility.\nConsider using the caret operator instead for safety.\n\nExamples:\n\n>=1.0\n>=1.0 \n>=1.0 =1.2\n\nHyphenated Version Range (-)\nInclusive set of versions. Partial versions on the right include are completed\nwith a wildcard. For example 1.0 - 2.0 is equivalent to >=1.0.0  as the\n2.0 becomes 2.0.*. On the other hand 1.0.0 - 2.1.0 is equivalent to\n>=1.0.0 .\nExample: 1.0 - 2.0\nWildcard Version Range (.*)\nYou can specify a pattern with a * wildcard. 1.0.* is the equivalent of\n>=1.0 .\nExample: 1.0.*\nNext Significant Release Operators\nTilde Version Range (~)\nThe ~ operator is best explained by example: ~1.2 is equivalent to\n>=1.2 , while ~1.2.3 is equivalent to >=1.2.3 . As you can see\nit is mostly useful for projects respecting semantic\nversioning. A common usage would be to mark the minimum\nminor version you depend on, like ~1.2 (which allows anything up to, but not\nincluding, 2.0). Since in theory there should be no backwards compatibility\nbreaks until 2.0, that works well. Another way of looking at it is that using\n~ specifies a minimum version, but allows the last digit specified to go up.\nExample: ~1.2\n\nNote: Although 2.0-beta.1 is strictly before 2.0, a version constraint\nlike ~1.2 would not install it. As said above ~1.2 only means the .2\ncan change but the 1. part is fixed.\nNote: The ~ operator has an exception on its behavior for the major\nrelease number. This means for example that ~1 is the same as ~1.0 as\nit will not allow the major number to increase trying to keep backwards\ncompatibility.\n\nCaret Version Range (^)\nThe ^ operator behaves very similarly, but it sticks closer to semantic\nversioning, and will always allow non-breaking updates. For example ^1.2.3\nis equivalent to >=1.2.3  as none of the releases until 2.0 should\nbreak backwards compatibility. For pre-1.0 versions it also acts with safety\nin mind and treats ^0.3 as >=0.3.0 .\nThis is the recommended operator for maximum interoperability when writing\nlibrary code.\nExample: ^1.2.3\nStability Constraints\nIf you are using a constraint that does not explicitly define a stability,\nComposer will default internally to -dev or -stable, depending on the\noperator(s) used. This happens transparently.\nIf you wish to explicitly consider only the stable release in the comparison,\nadd the suffix -stable.\nExamples:\n\n\n\nConstraint\nInternally\n\n\n\n\n 1.2.3\n=1.2.3.0-stable\n\n\n >1.2\n>1.2.0.0-stable\n\n\n >=1.2\n>=1.2.0.0-dev\n\n\n >=1.2-stable\n>=1.2.0.0-stable\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n 1 - 2\n>=1.0.0.0-dev \n\n\n ~1.3\n>=1.3.0.0-dev \n\n\n 1.4.*\n>=1.4.0.0-dev \n\n\n\nTo allow various stabilities without enforcing them at the constraint level\nhowever, you may use stability-flags like\n@ (e.g. @dev) to let composer know that a given package\ncan be installed in a different stability than your default minimum-stability\nsetting. All available stability flags are listed on the minimum-stability\nsection of the schema page.\nSummary\n\"require\": {\n    \"vendor/package\": \"1.3.2\", // exactly 1.3.2\n\n    // >, =, =1.3.2\", // anything above or equal to 1.3.2\n    \"vendor/package\": \"=1.3.0 =1.3.2 =1.3.0 =1.3.2 =0.3.2 \nTesting Version Constraints\nYou can test version constraints using semver.mwl.be.\nFill in a package name and it will autofill the default version constraint\nwhich Composer would add to your composer.json file. You can adjust the\nversion constraint and the tool will highlight all releases that match.\n"},"dev/DefaultPolicy.html":{"url":"dev/DefaultPolicy.html","title":"Default Policy","keywords":"","body":"Default Solver Policy\nA solver policy defines behaviour variables of the dependency solver.

A\nuseful example would be for a Drupal multisite setup where the package should be\ninstalled into your sites subdirectory. Here we are overriding the install path\nfor a module that uses composer/installers, as well as putting all packages of type\ndrupal-theme into a themes folder:\n{\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"installer-paths\": {\n            \"sites/example.com/modules/{$name}\": [\"vendor/package\"],\n            \"sites/example.com/themes/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-theme\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow the package would be installed to your folder location, rather than the default\ncomposer/installers determined location. In addition, installer-paths is\norder-dependent, which means moving a package by name should come before the installer\npath of a type:* that matches the same package.\n\nNote: You cannot use this to change the path of any package.

If you have not yet installed Composer, refer to the\nIntro chapter.\n\nNote: for the sake of simplicity, this introduction will assume you\nhave performed a local install of Composer.\n\ncomposer.json: Project setup\nTo start using Composer in your project, all you need is a composer.json\nfile. This file describes the dependencies of your project and may contain\nother metadata as well. It typically should go in the top-most directory of\nyour project/VCS repository. You can technically run Composer anywhere but\nif you want to publish a package to Packagist.org, it will have to be able\nto find the file at the top of your VCS repository.\nThe require key\nThe first (and often only) thing you specify in composer.json is the\nrequire key. You are telling Composer which\npackages your project depends on.\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"1.0.*\"\n    }\n}\n\nAs you can see, require takes an object that maps\npackage names (e.g. monolog/monolog) to version constraints (e.g.\n1.0.*).\nComposer uses this information to search for the right set of files in package\n\"repositories\" that you register using the repositories\nkey, or in Packagist, the default package repository. In the above example,\nsince no other repository has been registered in the composer.json file, it is\nassumed that the monolog/monolog package is registered on Packagist. (See more\nabout Packagist below, or read more about repositories\nhere).\nPackage names\nThe package name consists of a vendor name and the project's name. Often these\nwill be identical - the vendor name only exists to prevent naming clashes. For\nexample, it would allow two different people to create a library named json.\nOne might be named igorw/json while the other might be seldaek/json.\nRead more about publishing packages and package naming here.\n(Note that you can also specify \"platform packages\" as dependencies, allowing\nyou to require certain versions of server software. See\nplatform packages below.)\nPackage version constraints\nIn our example, we are requesting the Monolog package with the version constraint\n1.0.*.\nThis means any version in the 1.0 development branch, or any version that is\ngreater than or equal to 1.0 and less than 1.1 (>=1.0 ).\nPlease read versions for more in-depth information on\nversions, how versions relate to each other, and on version constraints.\n\nHow does Composer download the right files? When you specify a dependency in\ncomposer.json, Composer first takes the name of the package that you have requested\nand searches for it in any repositories that you have registered using the\nrepositories key. If you have not registered\nany extra repositories, or it does not find a package with that name in the\nrepositories you have specified, it falls back to Packagist (more below).\nWhen Composer finds the right package, either in Packagist or in a repo you have specified,\nit then uses the versioning features of the package's VCS (i.e., branches and tags)\nto attempt to find the best match for the version constraint you have specified. Be sure to read\nabout versions and package resolution in the versions article.\nNote: If you are trying to require a package but Composer throws an error\nregarding package stability, the version you have specified may not meet your\ndefault minimum stability requirements. By default, only stable releases are taken\ninto consideration when searching for valid package versions in your VCS.\nYou might run into this if you are trying to require dev, alpha, beta, or RC\nversions of a package. Read more about stability flags and the minimum-stability\nkey on the schema page.\n\nInstalling dependencies\nTo install the defined dependencies for your project, run the\ninstall command.\nphp composer.phar install\n\nWhen you run this command, one of two things may happen:\nInstalling without composer.lock\nIf you have never run the command before and there is also no composer.lock file present,\nComposer resolves all dependencies listed in your composer.json file and downloads\nthe latest version of their files into the vendor directory in your project. (The vendor\ndirectory is the conventional location for all third-party code in a project). In our\nexample from above, you would end up with the Monolog source files in\nvendor/monolog/monolog/. If Monolog listed any dependencies, those would also be in\nfolders under vendor/.\n\nTip: If you are using git for your project, you probably want to add\nvendor in your .gitignore. You really don't want to add all of that\nthird-party code to your versioned repository.\n\nWhen Composer has finished installing, it writes all of the packages and the exact versions\nof them that it downloaded to the composer.lock file, locking the project to those specific\nversions. You should commit the composer.lock file to your project repo so that all people\nworking on the project are locked to the same versions of dependencies (more below).\nInstalling with composer.lock\nThis brings us to the second scenario. If there is already a composer.lock file as well as a\ncomposer.json file when you run composer install, it means either you ran the\ninstall command before, or someone else on the project ran the install command and\ncommitted the composer.lock file to the project (which is good).\nEither way, running install when a composer.lock file is present resolves and installs\nall dependencies that you listed in composer.json, but Composer uses the exact versions listed\nin composer.lock to ensure that the package versions are consistent for everyone\nworking on your project. As a result you will have all dependencies requested by your\ncomposer.json file, but they may not all be at the very latest available versions\n(some of the dependencies listed in the composer.lock file may have released newer versions since\nthe file was created). This is by design, it ensures that your project does not break because of\nunexpected changes in dependencies.\nCommit your composer.lock file to version control\nCommitting this file to VC is important because it will cause anyone who sets\nup the project to use the exact same\nversions of the dependencies that you are using. Your CI server, production\nmachines, other developers in your team, everything and everyone runs on the\nsame dependencies, which mitigates the potential for bugs affecting only some\nparts of the deployments. Even if you develop alone, in six months when\nreinstalling the project you can feel confident the dependencies installed are\nstill working even if your dependencies released many new versions since then.\n(See note below about using the update command.)\n\nNote: For libraries it is not necessary to commit the lock\nfile, see also: Libraries - Lock file.\n\nUpdating dependencies to their latest versions\nAs mentioned above, the composer.lock file prevents you from automatically getting\nthe latest versions of your dependencies. To update to the latest versions, use the\nupdate command. This will fetch the latest matching\nversions (according to your composer.json file) and update the lock file\nwith the new versions. (This is equivalent to deleting the composer.lock file\nand running install again.)\nphp composer.phar update\n\n\nNote: Composer will display a Warning when executing an install command\nif the composer.lock has not been updated since changes were made to the\ncomposer.json that might affect dependency resolution.\n\nIf you only want to install, upgrade or remove one dependency, you can explicitly list it as an argument:\nphp composer.phar update monolog/monolog [...]\n\nPackagist\nPackagist is the main Composer repository. A Composer\nrepository is basically a package source: a place where you can get packages\nfrom. Packagist aims to be the central repository that everybody uses. This\nmeans that you can automatically require any package that is available there,\nwithout further specifying where Composer should look for the package.\nIf you go to the Packagist website (packagist.org),\nyou can browse and search for packages.\nAny open source project using Composer is recommended to publish their packages\non Packagist. A library does not need to be on Packagist to be used by Composer,\nbut it enables discovery and adoption by other developers more quickly.\nPlatform packages\nComposer has platform packages, which are virtual packages for things that are\ninstalled on the system but are not actually installable by Composer. This\nincludes PHP itself, PHP extensions and some system libraries.\n\nphp represents the PHP version of the user, allowing you to apply\nconstraints, e.g. ^7.1. To require a 64bit version of php, you can\nrequire the php-64bit package.\n\nhhvm represents the version of the HHVM runtime and allows you to apply\na constraint, e.g., ^2.3.\n\next- allows you to require PHP extensions (includes core\nextensions). Versioning can be quite inconsistent here, so it's often\na good idea to set the constraint to *.  An example of an extension\npackage name is ext-gd.\n\nlib- allows constraints to be made on versions of libraries used by\nPHP. The following are available: curl, iconv, icu, libxml,\nopenssl, pcre, uuid, xsl.\n\n\nYou can use show --platform to get a list of your locally\navailable platform packages.\nAutoloading\nFor libraries that specify autoload information, Composer generates a\nvendor/autoload.php file. You can include this file and start\nusing the classes that those libraries provide without any extra work:\nrequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n$log = new Monolog\\Logger('name');\n$log->pushHandler(new Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler('app.log', Monolog\\Logger::WARNING));\n$log->addWarning('Foo');\n\nYou can even add your own code to the autoloader by adding an\nautoload field to composer.json.\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": {\"Acme\\\\\": \"src/\"}\n    }\n}\n\nComposer will register a PSR-4 autoloader\nfor the Acme namespace.\nYou define a mapping from namespaces to directories. The src directory would\nbe in your project root, on the same level as vendor directory is. An example\nfilename would be src/Foo.php containing an Acme\\Foo class.\nAfter adding the autoload field, you have to re-run\nthis command:\nphp composer.phar dump-autoload\n\nThis command will re-generate the vendor/autoload.php file.\nSee the dump-autoload section for\nmore information.\nIncluding that file will also return the autoloader instance, so you can store\nthe return value of the include call in a variable and add more namespaces.\nThis can be useful for autoloading classes in a test suite, for example.\n$loader = require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n$loader->addPsr4('Acme\\\\Test\\\\', __DIR__);\n\nIn addition to PSR-4 autoloading, Composer also supports PSR-0, classmap and\nfiles autoloading. See the autoload reference for\nmore information.\nSee also the docs on optimizing the autoloader.\n\nNote: Composer provides its own autoloader. If you don't want to use that\none, you can include vendor/composer/autoload_*.php files, which return\nassociative arrays allowing you to configure your own autoloader.\n\n← Intro  |  Libraries →\n"},"02-libraries.html":{"url":"02-libraries.html","title":"02 Libraries","keywords":"","body":"Libraries\nThis chapter will tell you how to make your library installable through\nComposer.\nEvery project is a package\nAs soon as you have a composer.json in a directory, that directory is a\npackage.

In these cases,\nComposer infers versions from your VCS, and you should not specify a version\nin your composer.json file. (See the Versions article\nto learn about how Composer uses VCS branches and tags to resolve version\nconstraints.)\nIf you are maintaining packages by hand (i.e., without a VCS), you'll need to\nspecify the version explicitly by adding a version value in your composer.json\nfile:\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n\n\nNote: When you add a hardcoded version to a VCS, the version will conflict\nwith tag names. Composer will not be able to determine the version number.\n\nVCS Versioning\nComposer uses your VCS's branch and tag features to resolve the version\nconstraints you specify in your require field to specific sets of files.\nWhen determining valid available versions, Composer looks at all of your tags\nand branches and translates their names into an internal list of options that\nit then matches against the version constraint you provided.\nFor more on how Composer treats tags and branches and how it resolves package\nversion constraints, read the versions article.\nLock file\nFor your library you may commit the composer.lock file if you want to. This\ncan help your team to always test against the same dependency versions.\nHowever, this lock file will not have any effect on other projects that depend\non it. It only has an effect on the main project.\nIf you do not want to commit the lock file, and you are using git, add it to\nthe .gitignore.\nPublishing to a VCS\nOnce you have a VCS repository (version control system, e.g. git) containing a\ncomposer.json file, your library is already composer-installable. In this\nexample we will publish the acme/hello-world library on GitHub under\ngithub.com/username/hello-world.\nNow, to test installing the acme/hello-world package, we create a new\nproject locally. We will call it acme/blog. This blog will depend on\nacme/hello-world, which in turn depends on monolog/monolog. We can\naccomplish this by creating a new blog directory somewhere, containing a\ncomposer.json:\n{\n    \"name\": \"acme/blog\",\n    \"require\": {\n        \"acme/hello-world\": \"dev-master\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe name is not needed in this case, since we don't want to publish the blog\nas a library. It is added here to clarify which composer.json is being\ndescribed.\nNow we need to tell the blog app where to find the hello-world dependency.\nWe do this by adding a package repository specification to the blog's\ncomposer.json:\n{\n    \"name\": \"acme/blog\",\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/username/hello-world\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"acme/hello-world\": \"dev-master\"\n    }\n}\n\nFor more details on how package repositories work and what other types are\navailable, see Repositories.\nThat's all. You can now install the dependencies by running Composer's\ninstall command!\nRecap: Any git/svn/hg/fossil repository containing a composer.json can be\nadded to your project by specifying the package repository and declaring the\ndependency in the require field.\nPublishing to packagist\nAlright, so now you can publish packages. But specifying the VCS repository\nevery time is cumbersome. You don't want to force all your users to do that.\nThe other thing that you may have noticed is that we did not specify a package\nrepository for monolog/monolog. How did that work? The answer is Packagist.\nPackagist is the main package repository for\nComposer, and it is enabled by default. Anything that is published on\nPackagist is available automatically through Composer. Since\nMonolog is on Packagist, we\ncan depend on it without having to specify any additional repositories.\nIf we wanted to share hello-world with the world, we would publish it on\nPackagist as well.\nYou visit Packagist and hit the \"Submit\"\nbutton. This will prompt you to sign up if you haven't already, and then\nallows you to submit the URL to your VCS repository, at which point Packagist\nwill start crawling it. Once it is done, your package will be available to\nanyone!\n← Basic usage |  Command-line interface →\n"},"03-cli.html":{"url":"03-cli.html","title":"03 Cli","keywords":"","body":"Command-line interface / Commands\nYou've already learned how to use the command-line interface to do some\nthings. This chapter documents all the available commands.\nTo get help from the command-line, call composer or composer list\nto see the complete list of commands, then --help combined with any of those\ncan give you more information.\nAs Composer uses symfony/console you can call commands by short name if it's not ambiguous.\ncomposer dump\n\ncalls composer dump-autoload.\nGlobal Options\nThe following options are available with every command:\n\n--verbose (-v): Increase verbosity of messages.\n--help (-h): Display help information.\n--quiet (-q): Do not output any message.\n--no-interaction (-n): Do not ask any interactive question.\n--no-plugins: Disables plugins.\n--no-cache: Disables the use of the cache directory. Same as setting the COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR\nenv var to /dev/null (or NUL on Windows).\n--working-dir (-d): If specified, use the given directory as working directory.\n--profile: Display timing and memory usage information\n--ansi: Force ANSI output.\n--no-ansi: Disable ANSI output.\n--version (-V): Display this application version.\n\nProcess Exit Codes\n\n0: OK\n1: Generic/unknown error code\n2: Dependency solving error code\n\ninit\nIn the Libraries chapter we looked at how to create a\ncomposer.json by hand. There is also an init command available to do this.\nWhen you run the command it will interactively ask you to fill in the fields,\nwhile using some smart defaults.\nphp composer.phar init\n\nOptions\n\n--name: Name of the package.\n--description: Description of the package.\n--author: Author name of the package.\n--type: Type of package.\n--homepage: Homepage of the package.\n--require: Package to require with a version constraint. Should be\nin format foo/bar:1.0.0.\n--require-dev: Development requirements, see --require.\n--stability (-s): Value for the minimum-stability field.\n--license (-l): License of package.\n--repository: Provide one (or more) custom repositories. They will be stored\nin the generated composer.json, and used for auto-completion when prompting for\nthe list of requires. Every repository can be either an HTTP URL pointing\nto a composer repository or a JSON string which similar to what the\nrepositories key accepts.\n\ninstall / i\nThe install command reads the composer.json file from the current\ndirectory, resolves the dependencies, and installs them into vendor.\nphp composer.phar install\n\nIf there is a composer.lock file in the current directory, it will use the\nexact versions from there instead of resolving them. This ensures that\neveryone using the library will get the same versions of the dependencies.\nIf there is no composer.lock file, Composer will create one after dependency\nresolution.\nOptions\n\n--prefer-source: There are two ways of downloading a package: source\nand dist. For stable versions Composer will use the dist by default.\nThe source is a version control repository. If --prefer-source is\nenabled, Composer will install from source if there is one. This is\nuseful if you want to make a bugfix to a project and get a local git\nclone of the dependency directly.\n--prefer-dist: Reverse of --prefer-source, Composer will install\nfrom dist if possible. This can speed up installs substantially on build\nservers and other use cases where you typically do not run updates of the\nvendors. It is also a way to circumvent problems with git if you do not\nhave a proper setup.\n--dry-run: If you want to run through an installation without actually\ninstalling a package, you can use --dry-run. This will simulate the\ninstallation and show you what would happen.\n--dev: Install packages listed in require-dev (this is the default behavior).\n--no-dev: Skip installing packages listed in require-dev. The autoloader\ngeneration skips the autoload-dev rules.\n--no-autoloader: Skips autoloader generation.\n--no-scripts: Skips execution of scripts defined in composer.json.\n--no-progress: Removes the progress display that can mess with some\nterminals or scripts which don't handle backspace characters.\n--optimize-autoloader (-o): Convert PSR-0/4 autoloading to classmap to get a faster\nautoloader. This is recommended especially for production, but can take\na bit of time to run so it is currently not done by default.\n--classmap-authoritative (-a): Autoload classes from the classmap only.\nImplicitly enables --optimize-autoloader.\n--apcu-autoloader: Use APCu to cache found/not-found classes.\n--apcu-autoloader-prefix: Use a custom prefix for the APCu autoloader cache.\nImplicitly enables --apcu-autoloader.\n--ignore-platform-reqs: ignore all platform requirements (php, hhvm,\nlib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine does\nnot fulfill these.\nSee also the platform config option.\n--ignore-platform-req: ignore a specific platform requirement(php,\nhhvm, lib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine\ndoes not fulfill it.\n\nupdate / u\nIn order to get the latest versions of the dependencies and to update the\ncomposer.lock file, you should use the update command. This command is also\naliased as upgrade as it does the same as upgrade does if you are thinking\nof apt-get or similar package managers.\nphp composer.phar update\n\nThis will resolve all dependencies of the project and write the exact versions\ninto composer.lock.\nIf you only want to update a few packages and not all, you can list them as such:\nphp composer.phar update vendor/package vendor/package2\n\nYou can also use wildcards to update a bunch of packages at once:\nphp composer.phar update \"vendor/*\"\n\nIf you want to downgrade a package to a specific version without changing your\ncomposer.json you can use --with and provide a custom version constraint:\nphp composer.phar update --with vendor/package:2.0.1\n\nThe custom constraint has to be a subset of the existing constraint you have,\nand this feature is only available for your root package dependencies.\nIf you only want to update the package(s) for which you provide custom constraints\nusing --with, you can skip --with and just use constraints with the partial\nupdate syntax:\nphp composer.phar update vendor/package:2.0.1 vendor/package2:3.0.*\n\nOptions\n\n--prefer-source: Install packages from source when available.\n--prefer-dist: Install packages from dist when available.\n--dry-run: Simulate the command without actually doing anything.\n--dev: Install packages listed in require-dev (this is the default behavior).\n--no-dev: Skip installing packages listed in require-dev. The autoloader generation skips the autoload-dev rules.\n--no-install: Does not run the install step after updating the composer.lock file.\n--lock: Only updates the lock file hash to suppress warning about the\nlock file being out of date.\n--with: Temporary version constraint to add, e.g. foo/bar:1.0.0 or foo/bar=1.0.0\n--no-autoloader: Skips autoloader generation.\n--no-scripts: Skips execution of scripts defined in composer.json.\n--no-progress: Removes the progress display that can mess with some\nterminals or scripts which don't handle backspace characters.\n--with-dependencies (-w): Update also dependencies of packages in the argument list, except those which are root requirements.\n--with-all-dependencies (-W): Update also dependencies of packages in the argument list, including those which are root requirements.\n--optimize-autoloader (-o): Convert PSR-0/4 autoloading to classmap to get a faster\nautoloader.

Useful for testing minimal\nversions of requirements, generally used with --prefer-stable.\n--interactive: Interactive interface with autocompletion to select the packages to update.\n--root-reqs: Restricts the update to your first degree dependencies.\n\nSpecifying one of the words mirrors, lock, or nothing as an argument has the same effect as specifying the option --lock, for example composer update mirrors is exactly the same as composer update --lock.\nrequire\nThe require command adds new packages to the composer.json file from\nthe current directory. If no file exists one will be created on the fly.\nphp composer.phar require\n\nAfter adding/changing the requirements, the modified requirements will be\ninstalled or updated.\nIf you do not want to choose requirements interactively, you can pass them\nto the command.\nphp composer.phar require \"vendor/package:2.*\" vendor/package2:dev-master\n\nIf you do not specify a package, composer will prompt you to search for a package, and given results, provide a list of  matches to require.\nOptions\n\n--dev: Add packages to require-dev.\n--dry-run: Simulate the command without actually doing anything.\n--prefer-source: Install packages from source when available.\n--prefer-dist: Install packages from dist when available.\n--no-progress: Removes the progress display that can mess with some\nterminals or scripts which don't handle backspace characters.\n--no-update: Disables the automatic update of the dependencies (implies --no-install).\n--no-install: Does not run the install step after updating the composer.lock file.\n--no-scripts: Skips execution of scripts defined in composer.json.\n--update-no-dev: Run the dependency update with the --no-dev option.\n--update-with-dependencies (-w): Also update dependencies of the newly required packages, except those that are root requirements.\n--update-with-all-dependencies (-W): Also update dependencies of the newly required packages, including those that are root requirements.\n--ignore-platform-reqs: ignore all platform requirements (php, hhvm,\nlib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine does\nnot fulfill these.\nSee also the platform config option.\n--ignore-platform-req: ignore a specific platform requirement(php,\nhhvm, lib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine\ndoes not fulfill it.\n--prefer-stable: Prefer stable versions of dependencies.\n--prefer-lowest: Prefer lowest versions of dependencies. Useful for testing minimal\nversions of requirements, generally used with --prefer-stable.\n--sort-packages: Keep packages sorted in composer.json.\n--optimize-autoloader (-o): Convert PSR-0/4 autoloading to classmap to\nget a faster autoloader. This is recommended especially for production, but\ncan take a bit of time to run, so it is currently not done by default.\n--classmap-authoritative (-a): Autoload classes from the classmap only.\nImplicitly enables --optimize-autoloader.\n--apcu-autoloader: Use APCu to cache found/not-found classes.\n--apcu-autoloader-prefix: Use a custom prefix for the APCu autoloader cache.\nImplicitly enables --apcu-autoloader.\n\nremove\nThe remove command removes packages from the composer.json file from\nthe current directory.\nphp composer.phar remove vendor/package vendor/package2\n\nAfter removing the requirements, the modified requirements will be\nuninstalled.\nOptions\n\n--dev: Remove packages from require-dev.\n--dry-run: Simulate the command without actually doing anything.\n--no-progress: Removes the progress display that can mess with some\nterminals or scripts which don't handle backspace characters.\n--no-update: Disables the automatic update of the dependencies (implies --no-install).\n--no-install: Does not run the install step after updating the composer.lock file.\n--no-scripts: Skips execution of scripts defined in composer.json.\n--update-no-dev: Run the dependency update with the --no-dev option.\n--update-with-dependencies (-w): Also update dependencies of the removed packages.\n(Deprecated, is now default behavior)\n--update-with-all-dependencies (-W): Allows all inherited dependencies to be updated,\nincluding those that are root requirements.\n--ignore-platform-reqs: ignore all platform requirements (php, hhvm,\nlib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine does\nnot fulfill these.\nSee also the platform config option.\n--ignore-platform-req: ignore a specific platform requirement(php,\nhhvm, lib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine\ndoes not fulfill it.\n--optimize-autoloader (-o): Convert PSR-0/4 autoloading to classmap to\nget a faster autoloader.

This can be used\nto verify that a production server has all the extensions needed to run a\nproject after installing it for example.\nUnlike update/install, this command will ignore config.platform settings and\ncheck the real platform packages so you can be certain you have the required\nplatform dependencies.\nglobal\nThe global command allows you to run other commands like install, remove, require\nor update as if you were running them from the COMPOSER_HOME\ndirectory.\nThis is merely a helper to manage a project stored in a central location that\ncan hold CLI tools or Composer plugins that you want to have available everywhere.\nThis can be used to install CLI utilities globally. Here is an example:\nphp composer.phar global require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer\n\nNow the php-cs-fixer binary is available globally. Make sure your global\nvendor binaries directory is in your $PATH\nenvironment variable, you can get its location with the following command :\nphp composer.phar global config bin-dir --absolute\n\nIf you wish to update the binary later on you can run a global update:\nphp composer.phar global update\n\nsearch\nThe search command allows you to search through the current project's package\nrepositories. Usually this will be packagist. You pass it the terms you want\nto search for.\nphp composer.phar search monolog\n\nYou can also search for more than one term by passing multiple arguments.\nOptions\n\n--only-name (-N): Search only in name.\n--type (-t): Search for a specific package type.\n\nshow\nTo list all of the available packages, you can use the show command.\nphp composer.phar show\n\nTo filter the list you can pass a package mask using wildcards.\nphp composer.phar show monolog/*\n\nmonolog/monolog 1.19.0 Sends your logs to files, sockets, inboxes, databases and various web services\n\nIf you want to see the details of a certain package, you can pass the package\nname.\nphp composer.phar show monolog/monolog\n\nname     : monolog/monolog\nversions : master-dev, 1.0.2, 1.0.1, 1.0.0, 1.0.0-RC1\ntype     : library\nnames    : monolog/monolog\nsource   : [git] https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog.git 3d4e60d0cbc4b888fe5ad223d77964428b1978da\ndist     : [zip] https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/zipball/3d4e60d0cbc4b888fe5ad223d77964428b1978da 3d4e60d0cbc4b888fe5ad223d77964428b1978da\nlicense  : MIT\n\nautoload\npsr-0\nMonolog : src/\n\nrequires\nphp >=5.3.0\n\nYou can even pass the package version, which will tell you the details of that\nspecific version.\nphp composer.phar show monolog/monolog 1.0.2\n\nOptions\n\n--all : List all packages available in all your repositories.\n--installed (-i): List the packages that are installed (this is enabled by default, and deprecated).\n--locked: List the locked packages from composer.lock.\n--platform (-p): List only platform packages (php & extensions).\n--available (-a): List available packages only.\n--self (-s): List the root package info.\n--name-only (-N): List package names only.\n--path (-P): List package paths.\n--tree (-t): List your dependencies as a tree.

This lists\nall funding links from the installed dependencies. Use --format=json to\nget machine-readable output.\nOptions\n\n--format: Format of the output: text, json or summary (default: \"text\")\n\ndepends (why)\nThe depends command tells you which other packages depend on a certain\npackage. As with installation require-dev relationships are only considered\nfor the root package.\nphp composer.phar depends doctrine/lexer\n doctrine/annotations v1.2.7 requires doctrine/lexer (1.*)\n doctrine/common      v2.6.1 requires doctrine/lexer (1.*)\n\nYou can optionally specify a version constraint after the package to limit the\nsearch.\nAdd the --tree or -t flag to show a recursive tree of why the package is\ndepended upon, for example:\nphp composer.phar depends psr/log -t\npsr/log 1.0.0 Common interface for logging libraries\n|- aboutyou/app-sdk 2.6.11 (requires psr/log 1.0.*)\n|  `- __root__ (requires aboutyou/app-sdk ^2.6)\n|- monolog/monolog 1.17.2 (requires psr/log ~1.0)\n|  `- laravel/framework v5.2.16 (requires monolog/monolog ~1.11)\n|     `- __root__ (requires laravel/framework ^5.2)\n`- symfony/symfony v3.0.2 (requires psr/log ~1.0)\n   `- __root__ (requires symfony/symfony ^3.0)\n\nOptions\n\n--recursive (-r): Recursively resolves up to the root package.\n--tree (-t): Prints the results as a nested tree, implies -r.\n\nprohibits (why-not)\nThe prohibits command tells you which packages are blocking a given package\nfrom being installed.

[setting-valueN]\nsetting-key is a configuration option name and setting-value1 is a\nconfiguration value.  For settings that can take an array of values (like\ngithub-protocols), more than one setting-value arguments are allowed.\nYou can also edit the values of the following properties:\ndescription, homepage, keywords, license, minimum-stability,\nname, prefer-stable, type and version.\nSee the Config chapter for valid configuration options.\nOptions\n\n--global (-g): Operate on the global config file located at\n$COMPOSER_HOME/config.json by default.  Without this option, this command\naffects the local composer.json file or a file specified by --file.\n--editor (-e): Open the local composer.json file using in a text editor as\ndefined by the EDITOR env variable.  With the --global option, this opens\nthe global config file.\n--auth (-a): Affect auth config file (only used for --editor).\n--unset: Remove the configuration element named by setting-key.\n--list (-l): Show the list of current config variables.  With the --global\noption this lists the global configuration only.\n--file=\"...\" (-f): Operate on a specific file instead of composer.json. Note\nthat this cannot be used in conjunction with the --global option.\n--absolute: Returns absolute paths when fetching *-dir config values\ninstead of relative.\n--json: JSON decode the setting value, to be used with extra.* keys.\n--merge: Merge the setting value with the current value, to be used with extra.* keys in combination with --json.\n\nModifying Repositories\nIn addition to modifying the config section, the config command also supports making\nchanges to the repositories section by using it the following way:\nphp composer.phar config repositories.foo vcs https://github.com/foo/bar\n\nIf your repository requires more configuration options, you can instead pass its JSON representation :\nphp composer.phar config repositories.foo '{\"type\": \"vcs\", \"url\": \"http://svn.example.org/my-project/\", \"trunk-path\": \"master\"}'\n\nModifying Extra Values\nIn addition to modifying the config section, the config command also supports making\nchanges to the extra section by using it the following way:\nphp composer.phar config extra.foo.bar value\n\nThe dots indicate array nesting, a max depth of 3 levels is allowed though. The above\nwould set \"extra\": { \"foo\": { \"bar\": \"value\" } }.\nIf you have a complex value to add/modify, you can use the --json and --merge flags\nto edit extra fields as json:\nphp composer.phar config --json extra.foo.bar '{\"baz\": true, \"qux\": []}'\n\ncreate-project\nYou can use Composer to create new projects from an existing package. This is\nthe equivalent of doing a git clone/svn checkout followed by a composer install\nof the vendors.\nThere are several applications for this:\n\nYou can deploy application packages.\nYou can check out any package and start developing on patches for example.\nProjects with multiple developers can use this feature to bootstrap the\ninitial application for development.\n\nTo create a new project using Composer you can use the create-project command.\nPass it a package name, and the directory to create the project in. You can also\nprovide a version as third argument, otherwise the latest version is used.\nIf the directory does not currently exist, it will be created during installation.\nphp composer.phar create-project doctrine/orm path \"2.2.*\"\n\nIt is also possible to run the command without params in a directory with an\nexisting composer.json file to bootstrap a project.\nBy default the command checks for the packages on packagist.org.\nOptions\n\n--stability (-s): Minimum stability of package. Defaults to stable.\n--prefer-source: Install packages from source when available.\n--prefer-dist: Install packages from dist when available.\n--repository: Provide a custom repository to search for the package,\nwhich will be used instead of packagist. Can be either an HTTP URL pointing\nto a composer repository, a path to a local packages.json file, or a\nJSON string which similar to what the repositories\nkey accepts. You can use this multiple times to configure multiple repositories.\n--add-repository: Add the custom repository in the composer.json. If a lock\nfile is present it will be deleted and an update will be run instead of install.\n--dev: Install packages listed in require-dev.\n--no-dev: Disables installation of require-dev packages.\n--no-scripts: Disables the execution of the scripts defined in the root\npackage.\n--no-progress: Removes the progress display that can mess with some\nterminals or scripts which don't handle backspace characters.\n--no-secure-http: Disable the secure-http config option temporarily while\ninstalling the root package. Use at your own risk. Using this flag is a bad\nidea.\n--keep-vcs: Skip the deletion of the VCS metadata for the created\nproject. This is mostly useful if you run the command in non-interactive\nmode.\n--remove-vcs: Force-remove the VCS metadata without prompting.\n--no-install: Disables installation of the vendors.\n--ignore-platform-reqs: ignore all platform requirements (php, hhvm,\nlib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine does\nnot fulfill these.\nSee also the platform config option.\n--ignore-platform-req: ignore a specific platform requirement(php,\nhhvm, lib-* and ext-*) and force the installation even if the local machine\ndoes not fulfill it.\n--ask: Ask user to provide target directory for new project.\n\ndump-autoload (dumpautoload)\nIf you need to update the autoloader because of new classes in a classmap\npackage for example, you can use dump-autoload to do that without having to\ngo through an install or update.\nAdditionally, it can dump an optimized autoloader that converts PSR-0/4 packages\ninto classmap ones for performance reasons. In large applications with many\nclasses, the autoloader can take up a substantial portion of every request's\ntime. Using classmaps for everything is less convenient in development, but\nusing this option you can still use PSR-0/4 for convenience and classmaps for\nperformance.\nOptions\n\n--no-scripts: Skips the execution of all scripts defined in composer.json file.\n--optimize (-o): Convert PSR-0/4 autoloading to classmap to get a faster\nautoloader. This is recommended especially for production, but can take\na bit of time to run, so it is currently not done by default.\n--classmap-authoritative (-a): Autoload classes from the classmap only.\nImplicitly enables --optimize.\n--apcu: Use APCu to cache found/not-found classes.\n--apcu-prefix: Use a custom prefix for the APCu autoloader cache.\nImplicitly enables --apcu.\n--no-dev: Disables autoload-dev rules. (Deprecated: Composer now infers this\nautomatically according to the last install or update run.)\n--ignore-platform-reqs: ignore all php, hhvm, lib-* and ext-*\nrequirements and skip the platform check for these.\nSee also the platform config option.\n--ignore-platform-req: ignore a specific platform requirement (php, hhvm,\nlib-* and ext-*) and skip the platform check for it.\n\nclear-cache / clearcache / cc\nDeletes all content from Composer's cache directories.\nlicenses\nLists the name, version and license of every package installed. Use\n--format=json to get machine-readable output.\nOptions\n\n--format: Format of the output: text, json or summary (default: \"text\")\n--no-dev: Remove dev dependencies from the output\n\nrun-script\nOptions\n\n--timeout: Set the script timeout in seconds, or 0 for no timeout.\n--dev: Sets the dev mode.\n--no-dev: Disable dev mode.\n--list (-l): List user defined scripts.\n\nTo run scripts manually you can use this command,\ngive it the script name and optionally any required arguments.\nexec\nExecutes a vendored binary/script. You can execute any command and this will\nensure that the Composer bin-dir is pushed on your PATH before the command\nruns.\nOptions\n\n--list (-l): List the available composer binaries.\n\ndiagnose\nIf you think you found a bug, or something is behaving strangely, you might\nwant to run the diagnose command to perform automated checks for many common\nproblems.\nphp composer.phar diagnose\n\narchive\nThis command is used to generate a zip/tar archive for a given package in a\ngiven version. It can also be used to archive your entire project without\nexcluded/ignored files.\nphp composer.phar archive vendor/package 2.0.21 --format=zip\n\nOptions\n\n--format (-f): Format of the resulting archive: tar or zip (default:\n\"tar\")\n--dir: Write the archive to this directory (default: \".\")\n--file: Write the archive with the given file name.\n\nhelp\nTo get more information about a certain command, you can use help.\nphp composer.phar help install\n\nCommand-line completion\nCommand-line completion can be enabled by following instructions\non this page.\nEnvironment variables\nYou can set a number of environment variables that override certain settings.\nWhenever possible it is recommended to specify these settings in the config\nsection of composer.json instead. It is worth noting that the env vars will\nalways take precedence over the values specified in composer.json.\nCOMPOSER\nBy setting the COMPOSER env variable it is possible to set the filename of\ncomposer.json to something else.\nFor example:\nCOMPOSER=composer-other.json php composer.phar install\n\nThe generated lock file will use the same name: composer-other.lock in this example.\nCOMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER\nIf set to 1, this env disables the warning about running commands as root/super user.\nIt also disables automatic clearing of sudo sessions, so you should really only set this\nif you use Composer as super user at all times like in docker containers.\nCOMPOSER_ALLOW_XDEBUG\nIf set to 1, this env allows running Composer when the Xdebug extension is enabled, without restarting PHP without it.\nCOMPOSER_AUTH\nThe COMPOSER_AUTH var allows you to set up authentication as an environment variable.\nThe contents of the variable should be a JSON formatted object containing http-basic,\ngithub-oauth, bitbucket-oauth, ... objects as needed,\nand following the\nspec from the config.\nCOMPOSER_BIN_DIR\nBy setting this option you can change the bin (Vendor Binaries)\ndirectory to something other than vendor/bin.\nCOMPOSER_CACHE_DIR\nThe COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR var allows you to change the Composer cache directory,\nwhich is also configurable via the cache-dir option.\nBy default, it points to $COMPOSER_HOME/cache on *nix and macOS, and\nC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Composer (or %LOCALAPPDATA%/Composer) on Windows.\nCOMPOSER_CAFILE\nBy setting this environmental value, you can set a path to a certificate bundle\nfile to be used during SSL/TLS peer verification.\nCOMPOSER_DISABLE_XDEBUG_WARN\nIf set to 1, this env suppresses a warning when Composer is running with the Xdebug extension enabled.\nCOMPOSER_DISCARD_CHANGES\nThis env var controls the discard-changes config option.\nCOMPOSER_HOME\nThe COMPOSER_HOME var allows you to change the Composer home directory. This\nis a hidden, global (per-user on the machine) directory that is shared between\nall projects.\nUse composer config --global home to see the location of the home directory.\nBy default, it points to C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Composer on Windows\nand /Users//.composer on macOS. On *nix systems that follow the XDG Base\nDirectory Specifications,\nit points to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/composer. On other *nix systems, it points to\n/home//.composer.\nCOMPOSER_HOME/config.json\nYou may put a config.json file into the location which COMPOSER_HOME points\nto. Composer will merge this configuration with your project's composer.json\nwhen you run the install and update commands.\nThis file allows you to set repositories and\nconfiguration for the user's projects.\nIn case global configuration matches local configuration, the local\nconfiguration in the project's composer.json always wins.\nCOMPOSER_HTACCESS_PROTECT\nDefaults to 1. If set to 0, Composer will not create .htaccess files in the\ncomposer home, cache, and data directories.\nCOMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT\nIf set, the value is used as php's memory_limit.\nCOMPOSER_MIRROR_PATH_REPOS\nIf set to 1, this env changes the default path repository strategy to mirror instead\nof symlink. As it is the default strategy being set it can still be overwritten by\nrepository options.\nCOMPOSER_NO_INTERACTION\nIf set to 1, this env var will make Composer behave as if you passed the\n--no-interaction flag to every command. This can be set on build boxes/CI.\nCOMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT\nThis env var controls the time Composer waits for commands (such as git\ncommands) to finish executing. The default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).\nCOMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION\nBy setting this var you can specify the version of the root package, if it\ncannot be guessed from VCS info and is not present in composer.json.\nCOMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR\nBy setting this var you can make Composer install the dependencies into a\ndirectory other than vendor.\nhttp_proxy or HTTP_PROXY\nIf you are using Composer from behind an HTTP proxy, you can use the standard\nhttp_proxy or HTTP_PROXY env vars. Set it to the URL of your proxy.\nMany operating systems already set this variable for you.\nUsing http_proxy (lowercased) or even defining both might be preferable since\nsome tools like git or curl will only use the lower-cased http_proxy version.\nAlternatively you can also define the git proxy using\ngit config --global http.proxy .\nIf you are using Composer in a non-CLI context (i.e. integration into a CMS or\nsimilar use case), and need to support proxies, please provide the CGI_HTTP_PROXY\nenvironment variable instead. See httpoxy.org for further\ndetails.\nCOMPOSER_MAX_PARALLEL_HTTP\nSet to an integer to configure how many files can be downloaded in parallel. This\ndefaults to 12 and must be between 1 and 50. If your proxy has issues with\nconcurrency maybe you want to lower this. Increasing it should generally not result\nin performance gains.\nHTTP_PROXY_REQUEST_FULLURI\nIf you use a proxy, but it does not support the request_fulluri flag, then you\nshould set this env var to false or 0 to prevent Composer from setting the\nrequest_fulluri option.\nHTTPS_PROXY_REQUEST_FULLURI\nIf you use a proxy, but it does not support the request_fulluri flag for HTTPS\nrequests, then you should set this env var to false or 0 to prevent Composer\nfrom setting the request_fulluri option.\nCOMPOSER_SELF_UPDATE_TARGET\nIf set, makes the self-update command write the new Composer phar file into that path instead of overwriting itself. Useful for updating Composer on read-only filesystem.\nno_proxy or NO_PROXY\nIf you are behind a proxy and would like to disable it for certain domains, you\ncan use the no_proxy or NO_PROXY env var. Set it to a comma separated list of\ndomains the proxy should not be used for.\nThe env var accepts domains, IP addresses, and IP address blocks in CIDR\nnotation. You can restrict the filter to a particular port (e.g. :80). You\ncan also set it to * to ignore the proxy for all HTTP requests.\nCOMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK\nIf set to 1, disables network access (best effort). This can be used for debugging or\nto run Composer on a plane or a starship with poor connectivity.\nIf set to prime, GitHub VCS repositories will prime the cache, so it can then be used\nfully offline with 1.\nCOMPOSER_DEBUG_EVENTS\nIf set to 1, outputs information about events being dispatched, which can be\nuseful for plugin authors to identify what is firing when exactly.\n← Libraries  |  Schema →\n"},"04-schema.html":{"url":"04-schema.html","title":"04 Schema","keywords":"","body":"The composer.json schema\nThis chapter will explain all of the fields available in composer.json.\nJSON schema\nWe have a JSON schema that documents the format and\ncan also be used to validate your composer.json. In fact, it is used by the\nvalidate command. You can find it at: https://getcomposer.org/schema.json\nRoot Package\nThe root package is the package defined by the composer.json at the root of\nyour project. It is the main composer.json that defines your project\nrequirements.\nCertain fields only apply when in the root package context. One example of\nthis is the config field. Only the root package can define configuration.\nThe config of dependencies is ignored. This makes the config field\nroot-only.\n\nNote: A package can be the root package or not, depending on the context.\nFor example, if your project depends on the monolog library, your project\nis the root package. However, if you clone monolog from GitHub in order to\nfix a bug in it, then monolog is the root package.\n\nProperties\nname\nThe name of the package. It consists of vendor name and project name,\nseparated by /. Examples:\n\nmonolog/monolog\nigorw/event-source\n\nThe name must be lowercased and consist of words separated by -, . or _.\nThe complete name should match ^[a-z0-9]([_.-]?[a-z0-9]+)*/[a-z0-9](([_.]?|-{0,2})[a-z0-9]+)*$.\nThe name property is required for published packages (libraries).\n\nNote: Before Composer version 2.0, a name could contain any character, including white spaces.\n\ndescription\nA short description of the package. Usually this is one line long.\nRequired for published packages (libraries).\nversion\nThe version of the package. In most cases this is not required and should\nbe omitted (see below).\nThis must follow the format of X.Y.Z or vX.Y.Z with an optional suffix\nof -dev, -patch (-p), -alpha (-a), -beta (-b) or -RC.\nThe patch, alpha, beta and RC suffixes can also be followed by a number.\nExamples:\n\n1.0.0\n1.0.2\n1.1.0\n0.2.5\n1.0.0-dev\n1.0.0-alpha3\n1.0.0-beta2\n1.0.0-RC5\nv2.0.4-p1\n\nOptional if the package repository can infer the version from somewhere, such\nas the VCS tag name in the VCS repository. In that case it is also recommended\nto omit it.\n\nNote: Packagist uses VCS repositories, so the statement above is very\nmuch true for Packagist as well. Specifying the version yourself will\nmost likely end up creating problems at some point due to human error.\n\ntype\nThe type of the package. It defaults to library.\nPackage types are used for custom installation logic. If you have a package\nthat needs some special logic, you can define a custom type. This could be a\nsymfony-bundle, a wordpress-plugin or a typo3-cms-extension. These types\nwill all be specific to certain projects, and they will need to provide an\ninstaller capable of installing packages of that type.\nOut of the box, Composer supports four types:\n\nlibrary: This is the default. It will copy the files to vendor.\nproject: This denotes a project rather than a library. For example\napplication shells like the Symfony standard edition,\nCMSs like the SilverStripe installer\nor full fledged applications distributed as packages. This can for example\nbe used by IDEs to provide listings of projects to initialize when creating\na new workspace.\nmetapackage: An empty package that contains requirements and will trigger\ntheir installation, but contains no files and will not write anything to the\nfilesystem. As such, it does not require a dist or source key to be\ninstallable.\ncomposer-plugin: A package of type composer-plugin may provide an\ninstaller for other packages that have a custom type. Read more in the\ndedicated article.\n\nOnly use a custom type if you need custom logic during installation. It is\nrecommended to omit this field and have it default to library.\nkeywords\nAn array of keywords that the package is related to. These can be used for\nsearching and filtering.\nExamples:\n\nlogging\nevents\ndatabase\nredis\ntemplating\n\nOptional.\nhomepage\nA URL to the website of the project.\nOptional.\nreadme\nA relative path to the readme document.\nOptional.\ntime\nRelease date of the version.\nMust be in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.\nOptional.\nlicense\nThe license of the package. This can be either a string or an array of strings.\nThe recommended notation for the most common licenses is (alphabetical):\n\nApache-2.0\nBSD-2-Clause\nBSD-3-Clause\nBSD-4-Clause\nGPL-2.0-only / GPL-2.0-or-later\nGPL-3.0-only / GPL-3.0-or-later\nLGPL-2.1-only / LGPL-2.1-or-later\nLGPL-3.0-only / LGPL-3.0-or-later\nMIT\n\nOptional, but it is highly recommended to supply this. More identifiers are\nlisted at the SPDX Open Source License Registry.\nFor closed-source software, you may use \"proprietary\" as the license identifier.\nAn Example:\n{\n    \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n\nFor a package, when there is a choice between licenses (\"disjunctive license\"),\nmultiple can be specified as array.\nAn Example for disjunctive licenses:\n{\n    \"license\": [\n       \"LGPL-2.1-only\",\n       \"GPL-3.0-or-later\"\n    ]\n}\n\nAlternatively they can be separated with \"or\" and enclosed in parentheses;\n{\n    \"license\": \"(LGPL-2.1-only or GPL-3.0-or-later)\"\n}\n\nSimilarly, when multiple licenses need to be applied (\"conjunctive license\"),\nthey should be separated with \"and\" and enclosed in parentheses.\nauthors\nThe authors of the package. This is an array of objects.\nEach author object can have following properties:\n\nname: The author's name. Usually their real name.\nemail: The author's email address.\nhomepage: An URL to the author's website.\nrole: The author's role in the project (e.g. developer or translator)\n\nAn example:\n{\n    \"authors\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Nils Adermann\",\n            \"email\": \"naderman@naderman.de\",\n            \"homepage\": \"https://www.naderman.de\",\n            \"role\": \"Developer\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Jordi Boggiano\",\n            \"email\": \"j.boggiano@seld.be\",\n            \"homepage\": \"https://seld.be\",\n            \"role\": \"Developer\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nOptional, but highly recommended.\nsupport\nVarious information to get support about the project.\nSupport information includes the following:\n\nemail: Email address for support.\nissues: URL to the issue tracker.\nforum: URL to the forum.\nwiki: URL to the wiki.\nirc: IRC channel for support, as irc://server/channel.\nsource: URL to browse or download the sources.\ndocs: URL to the documentation.\nrss: URL to the RSS feed.\nchat: URL to the chat channel.\n\nAn example:\n{\n    \"support\": {\n        \"email\": \"support@example.org\",\n        \"irc\": \"irc://irc.freenode.org/composer\"\n    }\n}\n\nOptional.\nfunding\nA list of URLs to provide funding to the package authors for maintenance and\ndevelopment of new functionality.\nEach entry consists of the following\n\ntype: The type of funding, or the platform through which funding can be provided, e.g. patreon, opencollective, tidelift or github.\nurl: URL to a website with details, and a way to fund the package.\n\nAn example:\n{\n    \"funding\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"patreon\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.patreon.com/phpdoctrine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"tidelift\",\n            \"url\": \"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-doctrine_doctrine-bundle\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"other\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.doctrine-project.org/sponsorship.html\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nOptional.\nPackage links\nAll of the following take an object which maps package names to\nversions of the package via version constraints. Read more about\nversions here.\nExample:\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"1.0.*\"\n    }\n}\n\nAll links are optional fields.\nrequire and require-dev additionally support stability flags (root-only).\nThey take the form \"constraint@stability flag\".\nThese allow you to further restrict or expand the stability of a package beyond\nthe scope of the minimum-stability setting. You can apply\nthem to a constraint, or apply them to an empty constraint if you want to\nallow unstable packages of a dependency for example.\nExample:\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"1.0.*@beta\",\n        \"acme/foo\": \"@dev\"\n    }\n}\n\nIf one of your dependencies has a dependency on an unstable package you need to\nexplicitly require it as well, along with its sufficient stability flag.\nExample:\nAssuming doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle requires \"doctrine/data-fixtures\": \"dev-master\"\nthen inside the root composer.json you need to add the second line below to allow dev\nreleases for the doctrine/data-fixtures package :\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle\": \"dev-master\",\n        \"doctrine/data-fixtures\": \"@dev\"\n    }\n}\n\nrequire and require-dev additionally support explicit references (i.e.\ncommit) for dev versions to make sure they are locked to a given state, even\nwhen you run update. These only work if you explicitly require a dev version\nand append the reference with #. This is also a\nroot-only feature and will be ignored in\ndependencies.\nExample:\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"dev-master#2eb0c0978d290a1c45346a1955188929cb4e5db7\",\n        \"acme/foo\": \"1.0.x-dev#abc123\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nNote: This feature has severe technical limitations, as the\ncomposer.json metadata will still be read from the branch name you specify\nbefore the hash. You should therefore only use this as a temporary solution\nduring development to remediate transient issues, until you can switch to\ntagged releases. The Composer team does not actively support this feature\nand will not accept bug reports related to it.\n\nIt is also possible to inline-alias a package constraint so that it matches\na constraint that it otherwise would not. For more information see the\naliases article.\nrequire and require-dev also support references to specific PHP versions\nand PHP extensions your project needs to run successfully.\nExample:\n{\n    \"require\" : {\n        \"php\" : \">=7.4\",\n        \"ext-mbstring\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nNote: It is important to list PHP extensions your project requires.\nNot all PHP installations are created equal: some may miss extensions you\nmay consider as standard (such as ext-mysqli which is not installed by\ndefault in Fedora/CentOS minimal installation systems). Failure to list\nrequired PHP extensions may lead to a bad user experience: Composer will\ninstall your package without any errors but it will then fail at run-time.\nThe composer show --platform command lists all PHP extensions available on\nyour system. You may use it to help you compile the list of extensions you\nuse and require. Alternatively you may use third party tools to analyze\nyour project for the list of extensions used.\n\nrequire\nMap of packages required by this package. The package will not be installed\nunless those requirements can be met.\nrequire-dev (root-only)\nMap of packages required for developing this package, or running\ntests, etc. The dev requirements of the root package are installed by default.\nBoth install or update support the --no-dev option that prevents dev\ndependencies from being installed.\nconflict\nMap of packages that conflict with this version of this package. They\nwill not be allowed to be installed together with your package.\nNote that when specifying ranges like =1.1 in a conflict link,\nthis will state a conflict with all versions that are less than 1.0 and equal\nor newer than 1.1 at the same time, which is probably not what you want. You\nprobably want to go for =1.1 in this case.\nreplace\nMap of packages that are replaced by this package. This allows you to fork a\npackage, publish it under a different name with its own version numbers, while\npackages requiring the original package continue to work with your fork because\nit replaces the original package.\nThis is also useful for packages that contain sub-packages, for example the main\nsymfony/symfony package contains all the Symfony Components which are also\navailable as individual packages. If you require the main package it will\nautomatically fulfill any requirement of one of the individual components,\nsince it replaces them.\nCaution is advised when using replace for the sub-package purpose explained\nabove. You should then typically only replace using self.version as a version\nconstraint, to make sure the main package only replaces the sub-packages of\nthat exact version, and not any other version, which would be incorrect.\nprovide\nMap of packages that are provided by this package. This is mostly\nuseful for implementations of common interfaces. A package could depend on\nsome virtual package e.g. psr/logger-implementation, any library that implements\nthis logger interface would list it in provide. Implementors can then\nbe found on Packagist.org.\nUsing provide with the name of an actual package rather than a virtual one\nimplies that the code of that package is also shipped, in which case replace\nis generally a better choice. A common convention for packages providing an\ninterface and relying on other packages to provide an implementation (for\ninstance the PSR interfaces) is to use a -implementation suffix for the\nname of the virtual package corresponding to the interface package.\nsuggest\nSuggested packages that can enhance or work well with this package. These are\ninformational and are displayed after the package is installed, to give\nyour users a hint that they could add more packages, even though they are not\nstrictly required.\nThe format is like package links above, except that the values are free text\nand not version constraints.\nExample:\n{\n    \"suggest\": {\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"Allows more advanced logging of the application flow\",\n        \"ext-xml\": \"Needed to support XML format in class Foo\"\n    }\n}\n\nautoload\nAutoload mapping for a PHP autoloader.\nPSR-4 and PSR-0\nautoloading, classmap generation and files includes are supported.\nPSR-4 is the recommended way since it offers greater ease of use (no need\nto regenerate the autoloader when you add classes).\nPSR-4\nUnder the psr-4 key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the\npackage root. When autoloading a class like Foo\\\\Bar\\\\Baz a namespace prefix\nFoo\\\\ pointing to a directory src/ means that the autoloader will look for a\nfile named src/Bar/Baz.php and include it if present. Note that as opposed to\nthe older PSR-0 style, the prefix (Foo\\\\) is not present in the file path.\nNamespace prefixes must end in \\\\ to avoid conflicts between similar prefixes.\nFor example Foo would match classes in the FooBar namespace so the trailing\nbackslashes solve the problem: Foo\\\\ and FooBar\\\\ are distinct.\nThe PSR-4 references are all combined, during install/update, into a single\nkey => value array which may be found in the generated file\nvendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php.\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": {\n            \"Monolog\\\\\": \"src/\",\n            \"Vendor\\\\Namespace\\\\\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf you need to search for a same prefix in multiple directories,\nyou can specify them as an array as such:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": { \"Monolog\\\\\": [\"src/\", \"lib/\"] }\n    }\n}\n\nIf you want to have a fallback directory where any namespace will be looked for,\nyou can use an empty prefix like:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": { \"\": \"src/\" }\n    }\n}\n\nPSR-0\nUnder the psr-0 key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the\npackage root. Note that this also supports the PEAR-style non-namespaced convention.\nPlease note namespace declarations should end in \\\\ to make sure the autoloader\nresponds exactly. For example Foo would match in FooBar so the trailing\nbackslashes solve the problem: Foo\\\\ and FooBar\\\\ are distinct.\nThe PSR-0 references are all combined, during install/update, into a single key => value\narray which may be found in the generated file vendor/composer/autoload_namespaces.php.\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": {\n            \"Monolog\\\\\": \"src/\",\n            \"Vendor\\\\Namespace\\\\\": \"src/\",\n            \"Vendor_Namespace_\": \"src/\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf you need to search for a same prefix in multiple directories,\nyou can specify them as an array as such:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": { \"Monolog\\\\\": [\"src/\", \"lib/\"] }\n    }\n}\n\nThe PSR-0 style is not limited to namespace declarations only but may be\nspecified right down to the class level. This can be useful for libraries with\nonly one class in the global namespace. If the php source file is also located\nin the root of the package, for example, it may be declared like this:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": { \"UniqueGlobalClass\": \"\" }\n    }\n}\n\nIf you want to have a fallback directory where any namespace can be, you can\nuse an empty prefix like:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": { \"\": \"src/\" }\n    }\n}\n\nClassmap\nThe classmap references are all combined, during install/update, into a single\nkey => value array which may be found in the generated file\nvendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php. This map is built by scanning for\nclasses in all .php and .inc files in the given directories/files.\nYou can use the classmap generation support to define autoloading for all libraries\nthat do not follow PSR-0/4. To configure this you specify all directories or files\nto search for classes.\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"classmap\": [\"src/\", \"lib/\", \"Something.php\"]\n    }\n}\n\nWildcards (*) are also supported in a classmap paths, and expand to match any directory name:\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"classmap\": [\"src/addons/*/lib/\", \"3rd-party/*\", \"Something.php\"]\n    }\n}\n\nFiles\nIf you want to require certain files explicitly on every request then you can use\nthe files autoloading mechanism. This is useful if your package includes PHP functions\nthat cannot be autoloaded by PHP.\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"files\": [\"src/MyLibrary/functions.php\"]\n    }\n}\n\nExclude files from classmaps\nIf you want to exclude some files or folders from the classmap you can use the exclude-from-classmap property.\nThis might be useful to exclude test classes in your live environment, for example, as those will be skipped\nfrom the classmap even when building an optimized autoloader.\nThe classmap generator will ignore all files in the paths configured here. The paths are absolute from the package\nroot directory (i.e. composer.json location), and support * to match anything but a slash, and ** to\nmatch anything. ** is implicitly added to the end of the paths.\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"exclude-from-classmap\": [\"/Tests/\", \"/test/\", \"/tests/\"]\n    }\n}\n\nOptimizing the autoloader\nThe autoloader can have quite a substantial impact on your request time\n(50-100ms per request in large frameworks using a lot of classes). See the\narticle about optimizing the autoloader\nfor more details on how to reduce this impact.\nautoload-dev (root-only)\nThis section allows to define autoload rules for development purposes.\nClasses needed to run the test suite should not be included in the main autoload\nrules to avoid polluting the autoloader in production and when other people use\nyour package as a dependency.\nTherefore, it is a good idea to rely on a dedicated path for your unit tests\nand to add it within the autoload-dev section.\nExample:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": { \"MyLibrary\\\\\": \"src/\" }\n    },\n    \"autoload-dev\": {\n        \"psr-4\": { \"MyLibrary\\\\Tests\\\\\": \"tests/\" }\n    }\n}\n\ninclude-path\n\nDEPRECATED: This is only present to support legacy projects, and all new code\nshould preferably use autoloading. As such it is a deprecated practice, but the\nfeature itself will not likely disappear from Composer.\n\nA list of paths which should get appended to PHP's include_path.\nExample:\n{\n    \"include-path\": [\"lib/\"]\n}\n\nOptional.\ntarget-dir\n\nDEPRECATED: This is only present to support legacy PSR-0 style autoloading,\nand all new code should preferably use PSR-4 without target-dir and projects\nusing PSR-0 with PHP namespaces are encouraged to migrate to PSR-4 instead.\n\nDefines the installation target.\nIn case the package root is below the namespace declaration you cannot\nautoload properly. target-dir solves this problem.\nAn example is Symfony. There are individual packages for the components. The\nYaml component is under Symfony\\Component\\Yaml. The package root is that\nYaml directory. To make autoloading possible, we need to make sure that it\nis not installed into vendor/symfony/yaml, but instead into\nvendor/symfony/yaml/Symfony/Component/Yaml, so that the autoloader can load\nit from vendor/symfony/yaml.\nTo do that, autoload and target-dir are defined as follows:\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": { \"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Yaml\\\\\": \"\" }\n    },\n    \"target-dir\": \"Symfony/Component/Yaml\"\n}\n\nOptional.\nminimum-stability (root-only)\nThis defines the default behavior for filtering packages by stability. This\ndefaults to stable, so if you rely on a dev package, you should specify\nit in your file to avoid surprises.\nAll versions of each package are checked for stability, and those that are less\nstable than the minimum-stability setting will be ignored when resolving\nyour project dependencies. (Note that you can also specify stability requirements\non a per-package basis using stability flags in the version constraints that you\nspecify in a require block (see package links for more details).\nAvailable options (in order of stability) are dev, alpha, beta, RC,\nand stable.\nprefer-stable (root-only)\nWhen this is enabled, Composer will prefer more stable packages over unstable\nones when finding compatible stable packages is possible. If you require a\ndev version or only alphas are available for a package, those will still be\nselected granted that the minimum-stability allows for it.\nUse \"prefer-stable\": true to enable.\nrepositories (root-only)\nCustom package repositories to use.\nBy default Composer only uses the packagist repository. By specifying\nrepositories you can get packages from elsewhere.\nRepositories are not resolved recursively. You can only add them to your main\ncomposer.json. Repository declarations of dependencies' composer.jsons are\nignored.\nThe following repository types are supported:\n\ncomposer: A Composer repository is a packages.json file served\nvia the network (HTTP, FTP, SSH), that contains a list of composer.json\nobjects with additional dist and/or source information. The packages.json\nfile is loaded using a PHP stream. You can set extra options on that stream\nusing the options parameter.\nvcs: The version control system repository can fetch packages from git,\nsvn, fossil and hg repositories.\npackage: If you depend on a project that does not have any support for\ncomposer whatsoever you can define the package inline using a package\nrepository. You basically inline the composer.json object.\n\nFor more information on any of these, see Repositories.\nExample:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"composer\",\n            \"url\": \"http://packages.example.com\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"composer\",\n            \"url\": \"https://packages.example.com\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"ssl\": {\n                    \"verify_peer\": \"true\"\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"package\",\n            \"package\": {\n                \"name\": \"smarty/smarty\",\n                \"version\": \"3.1.7\",\n                \"dist\": {\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.smarty.net/files/Smarty-3.1.7.zip\",\n                    \"type\": \"zip\"\n                },\n                \"source\": {\n                    \"url\": \"https://smarty-php.googlecode.com/svn/\",\n                    \"type\": \"svn\",\n                    \"reference\": \"tags/Smarty_3_1_7/distribution/\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nNote: Order is significant here. When looking for a package, Composer\nwill look from the first to the last repository, and pick the first match.\nBy default Packagist is added last which means that custom repositories can\noverride packages from it.\n\nUsing JSON object notation is also possible. However, JSON key/value pairs\nare to be considered unordered so consistent behaviour cannot be guaranteed.\n{\n    \"repositories\": {\n         \"foo\": {\n             \"type\": \"composer\",\n             \"url\": \"http://packages.foo.com\"\n         }\n    }\n}\n\nconfig (root-only)\nA set of configuration options. It is only used for projects. See\nConfig for a description of each individual option.\nscripts (root-only)\nComposer allows you to hook into various parts of the installation process\nthrough the use of scripts.\nSee Scripts for events details and examples.\nextra\nArbitrary extra data for consumption by scripts.\nThis can be virtually anything. To access it from within a script event\nhandler, you can do:\n$extra = $event->getComposer()->getPackage()->getExtra();\n\nOptional.\nbin\nA set of files that should be treated as binaries and symlinked into the bin-dir\n(from config).\nSee Vendor Binaries for more details.\nOptional.\narchive\nA set of options for creating package archives.\nThe following options are supported:\n\nname: Allows configuring base name for archive.\nBy default (if not configured, and --file is not passed as command-line argument),\npreg_replace('#[^a-z0-9-_]#i', '-', name) is used.\n\nExample:\n{\n    \"name\": \"org/strangeName\",\n    \"archive\": {\n        \"name\": \"Strange_name\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nexclude: Allows configuring a list of patterns for excluded paths. The\npattern syntax matches .gitignore files. A leading exclamation mark (!) will\nresult in any matching files to be included even if a previous pattern\nexcluded them. A leading slash will only match at the beginning of the project\nrelative path. An asterisk will not expand to a directory separator.\n\nExample:\n{\n    \"archive\": {\n        \"exclude\": [\"/foo/bar\", \"baz\", \"/*.test\", \"!/foo/bar/baz\"]\n    }\n}\n\nThe example will include /dir/foo/bar/file, /foo/bar/baz, /file.php,\n/foo/my.test but it will exclude /foo/bar/any, /foo/baz, and /my.test.\nOptional.\nabandoned\nIndicates whether this package has been abandoned.\nIt can be boolean or a package name/URL pointing to a recommended alternative.\nExamples:\nUse \"abandoned\": true to indicates this package is abandoned.\nUse \"abandoned\": \"monolog/monolog\" to indicates this package is abandoned, and the\nrecommended alternative is  monolog/monolog.\nDefaults to false.\nOptional.\nnon-feature-branches\nA list of regex patterns of branch names that are non-numeric (e.g. \"latest\" or something),\nthat will NOT be handled as feature branches. This is an array of strings.\nIf you have non-numeric branch names, for example like \"latest\", \"current\", \"latest-stable\"\nor something, that do not look like a version number, then Composer handles such branches\nas feature branches. This means it searches for parent branches, that look like a version\nor ends at special branches (like master), and the root package version number becomes the\nversion of the parent branch or at least master or something.\nTo handle non-numeric named branches as versions instead of searching for a parent branch\nwith a valid version or special branch name like master, you can set patterns for branch\nnames, that should be handled as dev version branches.\nThis is really helpful when you have dependencies using \"self.version\", so that not dev-master,\nbut the same branch is installed (in the example: latest-testing).\nAn example:\nIf you have a testing branch, that is heavily maintained during a testing phase and is\ndeployed to your staging environment, normally composer show -s will give you versions : * dev-master.\nIf you configure latest-.* as a pattern for non-feature-branches like this:\n{\n    \"non-feature-branches\": [\"latest-.*\"]\n}\n\nThen composer show -s will give you versions : * dev-latest-testing.\nOptional.\n← Command-line interface  |  Repositories →\n"},"05-repositories.html":{"url":"05-repositories.html","title":"05 Repositories","keywords":"","body":"Repositories\nThis chapter will explain the concept of packages and repositories, what kinds\nof repositories are available, and how they work.\nConcepts\nBefore we look at the different types of repositories that exist, we need to\nunderstand some basic concepts that Composer is built on.\nPackage\nComposer is a dependency manager. It installs packages locally. A package is\nessentially a directory containing something. In this case it is PHP\ncode, but in theory it could be anything. And it contains a package\ndescription which has a name and a version. The name and the version are used\nto identify the package.\nIn fact, internally Composer sees every version as a separate package. While\nthis distinction does not matter when you are using Composer, it's quite\nimportant when you want to change it.\nIn addition to the name and the version, there is useful metadata. The\ninformation most relevant for installation is the source definition, which\ndescribes where to get the package contents. The package data points to the\ncontents of the package. And there are two options here: dist and source.\nDist: The dist is a packaged version of the package data. Usually a\nreleased version, usually a stable release.\nSource: The source is used for development. This will usually originate\nfrom a source code repository, such as git. You can fetch this when you want\nto modify the downloaded package.\nPackages can supply either of these, or even both. Depending on certain\nfactors, such as user-supplied options and stability of the package, one will\nbe preferred.\nRepository\nA repository is a package source. It's a list of packages/versions. Composer\nwill look in all your repositories to find the packages your project requires.\nBy default, only the Packagist.org repository is registered in Composer. You can\nadd more repositories to your project by declaring them in composer.json.\nRepositories are only available to the root package and the repositories\ndefined in your dependencies will not be loaded. Read the\nFAQ entry if you\nwant to learn why.\nWhen resolving dependencies, packages are looked up from repositories from\ntop to bottom, and by default, as soon as a package is found in one, Composer\nstops looking in other repositories. Read the\nrepository priorities article for more\ndetails and to see how to change this behavior.\nTypes\nComposer\nThe main repository type is the composer repository. It uses a single\npackages.json file that contains all of the package metadata.\nThis is also the repository type that packagist uses. To reference a\ncomposer repository, supply the path before the packages.json file.\nIn the case of packagist, that file is located at /packages.json, so the URL of\nthe repository would be repo.packagist.org. For example.org/packages.json the\nrepository URL would be example.org.\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"composer\",\n            \"url\": \"https://example.org\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\npackages\nThe only required field is packages. The JSON structure is as follows:\n{\n    \"packages\": {\n        \"vendor/package-name\": {\n            \"dev-master\": { @composer.json },\n            \"1.0.x-dev\": { @composer.json },\n            \"0.0.1\": { @composer.json },\n            \"1.0.0\": { @composer.json }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe @composer.json marker would be the contents of the composer.json from\nthat package version including as a minimum:\n\nname\nversion\ndist or source\n\nHere is a minimal package definition:\n{\n    \"name\": \"smarty/smarty\",\n    \"version\": \"3.1.7\",\n    \"dist\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://www.smarty.net/files/Smarty-3.1.7.zip\",\n        \"type\": \"zip\"\n    }\n}\n\nIt may include any of the other fields specified in the schema.\nnotify-batch\nThe notify-batch field allows you to specify a URL that will be called\nevery time a user installs a package. The URL can be either an absolute path\n(that will use the same domain as the repository), or a fully qualified URL.\nAn example value:\n{\n    \"notify-batch\": \"/downloads/\"\n}\n\nFor example.org/packages.json containing a monolog/monolog package, this\nwould send a POST request to example.org/downloads/ with following\nJSON request body:\n{\n    \"downloads\": [\n        {\"name\": \"monolog/monolog\", \"version\": \"1.2.1.0\"}\n    ]\n}\n\nThe version field will contain the normalized representation of the version\nnumber.\nThis field is optional.\nprovider-includes and providers-url\nThe provider-includes field allows you to list a set of files that list\npackage names provided by this repository. The hash should be a sha256 of\nthe files in this case.\nThe providers-url describes how provider files are found on the server. It\nis an absolute path from the repository root. It must contain the placeholders\n%package% and %hash%.\nAn example:\n{\n    \"provider-includes\": {\n        \"providers-a.json\": {\n            \"sha256\": \"f5b4bc0b354108ef08614e569c1ed01a2782e67641744864a74e788982886f4c\"\n        },\n        \"providers-b.json\": {\n            \"sha256\": \"b38372163fac0573053536f5b8ef11b86f804ea8b016d239e706191203f6efac\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"providers-url\": \"/p/%package%$%hash%.json\"\n}\n\nThose files contain lists of package names and hashes to verify the file\nintegrity, for example:\n{\n    \"providers\": {\n        \"acme/foo\": {\n            \"sha256\": \"38968de1305c2e17f4de33aea164515bc787c42c7e2d6e25948539a14268bb82\"\n        },\n        \"acme/bar\": {\n            \"sha256\": \"4dd24c930bd6e1103251306d6336ac813b563a220d9ca14f4743c032fb047233\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe file above declares that acme/foo and acme/bar can be found in this\nrepository, by loading the file referenced by providers-url, replacing\n%package% by the vendor namespaced package name and %hash% by the\nsha256 field. Those files themselves contain package definitions as\ndescribed above.\nThese fields are optional. You probably don't need them for your own custom\nrepository.\nstream options\nThe packages.json file is loaded using a PHP stream. You can set extra\noptions on that stream using the options parameter. You can set any valid\nPHP stream context option. See Context options and\nparameters for more information.\nVCS\nVCS stands for version control system. This includes versioning systems like\ngit, svn, fossil or hg. Composer has a repository type for installing packages\nfrom these systems.\nLoading a package from a VCS repository\nThere are a few use cases for this. The most common one is maintaining your\nown fork of a third party library. If you are using a certain library for your\nproject, and you decide to change something in the library, you will want your\nproject to use the patched version. If the library is on GitHub (this is the\ncase most of the time), you can fork it there and push your changes to\nyour fork. After that you update the project's composer.json. All you have\nto do is add your fork as a repository and update the version constraint to\npoint to your custom branch. In composer.json, you should prefix your custom\nbranch name with \"dev-\". For version constraint naming conventions see\nLibraries for more information.\nExample assuming you patched monolog to fix a bug in the bugfix branch:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/igorw/monolog\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"monolog/monolog\": \"dev-bugfix\"\n    }\n}\n\nWhen you run php composer.phar update, you should get your modified version\nof monolog/monolog instead of the one from packagist.\nNote that you should not rename the package unless you really intend to fork\nit in the long term, and completely move away from the original package.\nComposer will correctly pick your package over the original one since the\ncustom repository has priority over packagist. If you want to rename the\npackage, you should do so in the default (often master) branch and not in a\nfeature branch, since the package name is taken from the default branch.\nAlso note that the override will not work if you change the name property\nin your forked repository's composer.json file as this needs to match the\noriginal for the override to work.\nIf other dependencies rely on the package you forked, it is possible to\ninline-alias it so that it matches a constraint that it otherwise would not.\nFor more information see the aliases article.\nUsing private repositories\nExactly the same solution allows you to work with your private repositories at\nGitHub and BitBucket:\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"vendor/my-private-repo\": \"dev-master\"\n    },\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\":  \"git@bitbucket.org:vendor/my-private-repo.git\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThe only requirement is the installation of SSH keys for a git client.\nGit alternatives\nGit is not the only version control system supported by the VCS repository.\nThe following are supported:\n\nGit: git-scm.com\nSubversion: subversion.apache.org\nMercurial: mercurial-scm.org\nFossil: fossil-scm.org\n\nTo get packages from these systems you need to have their respective clients\ninstalled. That can be inconvenient. And for this reason there is special\nsupport for GitHub and BitBucket that use the APIs provided by these sites, to\nfetch the packages without having to install the version control system. The\nVCS repository provides dists for them that fetch the packages as zips.\n\nGitHub: github.com (Git)\nBitBucket: bitbucket.org (Git and Mercurial)\n\nThe VCS driver to be used is detected automatically based on the URL. However,\nshould you need to specify one for whatever reason, you can use git-bitbucket,\nhg-bitbucket, github, gitlab, perforce, fossil, git, svn or hg\nas the repository type instead of vcs.\nIf you set the no-api key to true on a github repository it will clone the\nrepository as it would with any other git repository instead of using the\nGitHub API. But unlike using the git driver directly, Composer will still\nattempt to use github's zip files.\nPlease note:\n\nTo let Composer choose which driver to use the repository type needs to be defined as \"vcs\"\nIf you already used a private repository, this means Composer should have cloned it in cache. If you want to install the same package with drivers, remember to launch the command composer clearcache followed by the command composer update to update composer cache and install the package from dist.\n\nBitBucket Driver Configuration\n\nNote that the repository endpoint for BitBucket needs to be https rather than git.\n\nAfter setting up your bitbucket repository, you will also need to\nset up authentication.\nSubversion Options\nSince Subversion has no native concept of branches and tags, Composer assumes\nby default that code is located in $url/trunk, $url/branches and\n$url/tags. If your repository has a different layout you can change those\nvalues. For example if you used capitalized names you could configure the\nrepository like this:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"http://svn.example.org/projectA/\",\n            \"trunk-path\": \"Trunk\",\n            \"branches-path\": \"Branches\",\n            \"tags-path\": \"Tags\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nIf you have no branches or tags directory you can disable them entirely by\nsetting the branches-path or tags-path to false.\nIf the package is in a sub-directory, e.g. /trunk/foo/bar/composer.json and\n/tags/1.0/foo/bar/composer.json, then you can make Composer access it by\nsetting the \"package-path\" option to the sub-directory, in this example it\nwould be \"package-path\": \"foo/bar/\".\nIf you have a private Subversion repository you can save credentials in the\nhttp-basic section of your config (See Schema):\n{\n    \"http-basic\": {\n        \"svn.example.org\": {\n            \"username\": \"username\",\n            \"password\": \"password\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf your Subversion client is configured to store credentials by default these\ncredentials will be saved for the current user and existing saved credentials\nfor this server will be overwritten. To change this behavior by setting the\n\"svn-cache-credentials\" option in your repository configuration:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"http://svn.example.org/projectA/\",\n            \"svn-cache-credentials\": false\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nPackage\nIf you want to use a project that does not support Composer through any of the\nmeans above, you still can define the package yourself by using a package\nrepository.\nBasically, you define the same information that is included in the composer\nrepository's packages.json, but only for a single package. Again, the\nminimum required fields are name, version, and either of dist or\nsource.\nHere is an example for the smarty template engine:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"package\",\n            \"package\": {\n                \"name\": \"smarty/smarty\",\n                \"version\": \"3.1.7\",\n                \"dist\": {\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.smarty.net/files/Smarty-3.1.7.zip\",\n                    \"type\": \"zip\"\n                },\n                \"source\": {\n                    \"url\": \"http://smarty-php.googlecode.com/svn/\",\n                    \"type\": \"svn\",\n                    \"reference\": \"tags/Smarty_3_1_7/distribution/\"\n                },\n                \"autoload\": {\n                    \"classmap\": [\"libs/\"]\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"smarty/smarty\": \"3.1.*\"\n    }\n}\n\nTypically, you would leave the source part off, as you don't really need it.\n\nNote: This repository type has a few limitations and should be avoided\nwhenever possible:\n\nComposer will not update the package unless you change the version field.\nComposer will not update the commit references, so if you use master as\nreference you will have to delete the package to force an update, and will\nhave to deal with an unstable lock file.\n\n\nThe \"package\" key in a package repository may be set to an array to define multiple versions of a package:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"package\",\n            \"package\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"foo/bar\",\n                    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n                    ...\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"foo/bar\",\n                    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n                    ...\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nHosting your own\nWhile you will probably want to put your packages on packagist most of the\ntime, there are some use cases for hosting your own repository.\n\nPrivate company packages: If you are part of a company that uses Composer\nfor their packages internally, you might want to keep those packages private.\n\nSeparate ecosystem: If you have a project which has its own ecosystem,\nand the packages aren't really reusable by the greater PHP community, you\nmight want to keep them separate to packagist. An example of this would be\nwordpress plugins.\n\n\nFor hosting your own packages, a native composer type of repository is\nrecommended, which provides the best performance.\nThere are a few tools that can help you create a composer repository.\nPrivate Packagist\nPrivate Packagist is a hosted or self-hosted\napplication providing private package hosting as well as mirroring of\nGitHub, Packagist.org and other package repositories.\nCheck out Packagist.com for more information.\nSatis\nSatis is a static composer repository generator. It is a bit like an ultra-\nlightweight, static file-based version of packagist.\nYou give it a composer.json containing repositories, typically VCS and\npackage repository definitions. It will fetch all the packages that are\nrequired and dump a packages.json that is your composer repository.\nCheck the satis GitHub repository and\nthe handling private packages article for more\ninformation.\nArtifact\nThere are some cases, when there is no ability to have one of the previously\nmentioned repository types online, even the VCS one. A typical example could be\ncross-organisation library exchange through build artifacts. Of course, most\nof the time these are private. To use these archives as-is, one can use a\nrepository of type artifact with a folder containing ZIP or TAR archives of\nthose private packages:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"artifact\",\n            \"url\": \"path/to/directory/with/zips/\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"private-vendor-one/core\": \"15.6.2\",\n        \"private-vendor-two/connectivity\": \"*\",\n        \"acme-corp/parser\": \"10.3.5\"\n    }\n}\n\nEach zip artifact is a ZIP archive with composer.json in root folder:\nunzip -l acme-corp-parser-10.3.5.zip\n\ncomposer.json\n...\n\nIf there are two archives with different versions of a package, they are both\nimported. When an archive with a newer version is added in the artifact folder\nand you run update, that version will be imported as well and Composer will\nupdate to the latest version.\nPath\nIn addition to the artifact repository, you can use the path one, which allows\nyou to depend on a local directory, either absolute or relative. This can be\nespecially useful when dealing with monolithic repositories.\nFor instance, if you have the following directory structure in your repository:\n...\n├── apps\n│   └── my-app\n│       └── composer.json\n├── packages\n│   └── my-package\n│       └── composer.json\n...\nThen, to add the package my/package as a dependency, in your\napps/my-app/composer.json file, you can use the following configuration:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"path\",\n            \"url\": \"../../packages/my-package\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"my/package\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n\nIf the package is a local VCS repository, the version may be inferred by\nthe branch or tag that is currently checked out. Otherwise, the version should\nbe explicitly defined in the package's composer.json file. If the version\ncannot be resolved by these means, it is assumed to be dev-master.\nWhen the version cannot be inferred from the local VCS repository, or when you\nwant to override the version, you can use the versions option when declaring\nthe repository:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"path\",\n            \"url\": \"../../packages/my-package\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"versions\": {\n                    \"my/package\": \"4.2-dev\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThe local package will be symlinked if possible, in which case the output in\nthe console will read Symlinking from ../../packages/my-package. If symlinking\nis not possible the package will be copied. In that case, the console will\noutput Mirrored from ../../packages/my-package.\nInstead of default fallback strategy you can force to use symlink with\n\"symlink\": true or mirroring with \"symlink\": false option. Forcing\nmirroring can be useful when deploying or generating package from a\nmonolithic repository.\n\nNote: On Windows, directory symlinks are implemented using NTFS junctions\nbecause they can be created by non-admin users. Mirroring will always be used\non versions below Windows 7 or if proc_open has been disabled.\n\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"path\",\n            \"url\": \"../../packages/my-package\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"symlink\": false\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nLeading tildes are expanded to the current user's home folder, and environment\nvariables are parsed in both Windows and Linux/Mac notations. For example\n~/git/mypackage will automatically load the mypackage clone from\n/home//git/mypackage, equivalent to $HOME/git/mypackage or\n%USERPROFILE%/git/mypackage.\n\nNote: Repository paths can also contain wildcards like * and ?.\nFor details, see the PHP glob function.\n\nDisabling Packagist.org\nYou can disable the default Packagist.org repository by adding this to your\ncomposer.json:\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"packagist.org\": false\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nYou can disable Packagist.org globally by using the global config flag:\ncomposer config -g repo.packagist false\n\n← Schema  |  Config →\n"},"06-config.html":{"url":"06-config.html","title":"06 Config","keywords":"","body":"Config\nThis chapter will describe the config section of the composer.json\nschema.\nprocess-timeout\nThe timeout in seconds for process executions, defaults to 300 (5mins).\nThe duration processes like git clones can run before\nComposer assumes they died out. You may need to make this higher if you have a\nslow connection or huge vendors.\nTo disable the process timeout on a custom command under scripts, a static\nhelper is available:\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": [\n            \"Composer\\\\Config::disableProcessTimeout\",\n            \"phpunit\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nuse-include-path\nDefaults to false. If true, the Composer autoloader will also look for classes\nin the PHP include path.\npreferred-install\nDefaults to auto and can be any of source, dist or auto. This option\nallows you to set the install method Composer will prefer to use. Can\noptionally be a hash of patterns for more granular install preferences.\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"preferred-install\": {\n            \"my-organization/stable-package\": \"dist\",\n            \"my-organization/*\": \"source\",\n            \"partner-organization/*\": \"auto\",\n            \"*\": \"dist\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nNote: Order matters. More specific patterns should be earlier than\nmore relaxed patterns. When mixing the string notation with the hash\nconfiguration in global and package configurations the string notation\nis translated to a * package pattern.\n\nstore-auths\nWhat to do after prompting for authentication, one of: true (always store),\nfalse (do not store) and \"prompt\" (ask every time), defaults to \"prompt\".\ngithub-protocols\nDefaults to [\"https\", \"ssh\", \"git\"]. A list of protocols to use when cloning\nfrom github.com, in priority order. By default git is present but only if secure-http\nis disabled, as the git protocol is not encrypted. If you want your origin remote\npush URLs to be using https and not ssh (git@github.com:...), then set the protocol\nlist to be only [\"https\"] and Composer will stop overwriting the push URL to an ssh\nURL.\ngithub-oauth\nA list of domain names and oauth keys. For example using {\"github.com\":\n\"oauthtoken\"} as the value of this option will use oauthtoken to access\nprivate repositories on github and to circumvent the low IP-based rate limiting\nof their API. Composer may prompt for credentials when needed, but these can also be\nmanually set. Read more on how to get an OAuth token for GitHub and cli syntax\nhere.\ngitlab-oauth\nA list of domain names and oauth keys. For example using {\"gitlab.com\":\n\"oauthtoken\"} as the value of this option will use oauthtoken to access\nprivate repositories on gitlab. Please note: If the package is not hosted at\ngitlab.com the domain names must be also specified with the\ngitlab-domains option.\nFurther info can also be found here\ngitlab-token\nA list of domain names and private tokens. Private token can be either simple\nstring, or array with username and token. For example using {\"gitlab.com\":\n\"privatetoken\"} as the value of this option will use privatetoken to access\nprivate repositories on gitlab. Using {\"gitlab.com\": {\"username\": \"gitlabuser\",\n \"token\": \"privatetoken\"}} will use both username and token for gitlab deploy\ntoken functionality (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/)\nPlease note: If the package is not hosted at\ngitlab.com the domain names must be also specified with the\ngitlab-domains option. The token must have\napi or read_api scope.\nFurther info can also be found here\ndisable-tls\nDefaults to false. If set to true all HTTPS URLs will be tried with HTTP\ninstead and no network level encryption is performed. Enabling this is a\nsecurity risk and is NOT recommended. The better way is to enable the\nphp_openssl extension in php.ini. Enabling this will implicitly disable the\nsecure-http option.\nsecure-http\nDefaults to true. If set to true only HTTPS URLs are allowed to be\ndownloaded via Composer. If you really absolutely need HTTP access to something\nthen you can disable it, but using Let's Encrypt to\nget a free SSL certificate is generally a better alternative.\nbitbucket-oauth\nA list of domain names and consumers. For example using {\"bitbucket.org\":\n{\"consumer-key\": \"myKey\", \"consumer-secret\": \"mySecret\"}}.\nRead more here.\ncafile\nLocation of Certificate Authority file on local filesystem. In PHP 5.6+ you\nshould rather set this via openssl.cafile in php.ini, although PHP 5.6+ should\nbe able to detect your system CA file automatically.\ncapath\nIf cafile is not specified or if the certificate is not found there, the\ndirectory pointed to by capath is searched for a suitable certificate.\ncapath must be a correctly hashed certificate directory.\nhttp-basic\nA list of domain names and username/passwords to authenticate against them. For\nexample using {\"example.org\": {\"username\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"foo\"}} as the\nvalue of this option will let Composer authenticate against example.org.\nMore info can be found here.\nbearer\nA list of domain names and tokens to authenticate against them. For example using\n{\"example.org\": \"foo\"} as the value of this option will let Composer authenticate\nagainst example.org using an Authorization: Bearer foo header.\nplatform\nLets you fake platform packages (PHP and extensions) so that you can emulate a\nproduction env or define your target platform in the config. Example: {\"php\":\n\"7.0.3\", \"ext-something\": \"4.0.3\"}.\nThis will make sure that no package requiring more than PHP 7.0.3 can be installed\nregardless of the actual PHP version you run locally. However it also means\nthe dependencies are not checked correctly anymore, if you run PHP 5.6 it will\ninstall fine as it assumes 7.0.3, but then it will fail at runtime.\nTherefore if you use this it is recommended, and safer, to also run the\ncheck-platform-reqs command as part of your\ndeployment strategy.\nIf a dependency requires some extension that you do not have installed locally\nyou may ignore it instead by passing --ignore-platform-req=ext-foo to update,\ninstall or require. In the long run though you should install required\nextensions as if you ignore one now and a new package you add a month later also\nrequires it, you may introduce issues in production unknowingly.\nvendor-dir\nDefaults to vendor. You can install dependencies into a different directory if\nyou want to. $HOME and ~ will be replaced by your home directory's path in\nvendor-dir and all *-dir options below.\nbin-dir\nDefaults to vendor/bin. If a project includes binaries, they will be symlinked\ninto this directory.\ndata-dir\nDefaults to C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Composer on Windows,\n$XDG_DATA_HOME/composer on unix systems that follow the XDG Base Directory\nSpecifications, and $home on other unix systems. Right now it is only\nused for storing past composer.phar files to be able to rollback to older\nversions. See also COMPOSER_HOME.\ncache-dir\nDefaults to C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Composer on Windows,\n$XDG_CACHE_HOME/composer on unix systems that follow the XDG Base Directory\nSpecifications, and $home/cache on other unix systems. Stores all the caches\nused by Composer. See also COMPOSER_HOME.\ncache-files-dir\nDefaults to $cache-dir/files. Stores the zip archives of packages.\ncache-repo-dir\nDefaults to $cache-dir/repo. Stores repository metadata for the composer\ntype and the VCS repos of type svn, fossil, github and bitbucket.\ncache-vcs-dir\nDefaults to $cache-dir/vcs. Stores VCS clones for loading VCS repository\nmetadata for the git/hg types and to speed up installs.\ncache-files-ttl\nDefaults to 15552000 (6 months). Composer caches all dist (zip, tar, ...)\npackages that it downloads. Those are purged after six months of being unused by\ndefault. This option allows you to tweak this duration (in seconds) or disable\nit completely by setting it to 0.\ncache-files-maxsize\nDefaults to 300MiB. Composer caches all dist (zip, tar, ...) packages that it\ndownloads. When the garbage collection is periodically ran, this is the maximum\nsize the cache will be able to use. Older (less used) files will be removed\nfirst until the cache fits.\ncache-read-only\nDefaults to false. Whether to use the Composer cache in read-only mode.\nbin-compat\nDefaults to auto. Determines the compatibility of the binaries to be installed.\nIf it is auto then Composer only installs .bat proxy files when on Windows. If\nset to full then both .bat files for Windows and scripts for Unix-based\noperating systems will be installed for each binary. This is mainly useful if you\nrun Composer inside a linux VM but still want the .bat proxies available for use\nin the Windows host OS.\nprepend-autoloader\nDefaults to true. If false, the Composer autoloader will not be prepended to\nexisting autoloaders. This is sometimes required to fix interoperability issues\nwith other autoloaders.\nautoloader-suffix\nDefaults to null. String to be used as a suffix for the generated Composer\nautoloader. When null a random one will be generated.\noptimize-autoloader\nDefaults to false. If true, always optimize when dumping the autoloader.\nsort-packages\nDefaults to false. If true, the require command keeps packages sorted\nby name in composer.json when adding a new package.\nclassmap-authoritative\nDefaults to false. If true, the Composer autoloader will only load classes\nfrom the classmap. Implies optimize-autoloader.\napcu-autoloader\nDefaults to false. If true, the Composer autoloader will check for APCu and\nuse it to cache found/not-found classes when the extension is enabled.\ngithub-domains\nDefaults to [\"github.com\"]. A list of domains to use in github mode. This is\nused for GitHub Enterprise setups.\ngithub-expose-hostname\nDefaults to true. If false, the OAuth tokens created to access the\ngithub API will have a date instead of the machine hostname.\ngitlab-domains\nDefaults to [\"gitlab.com\"]. A list of domains of GitLab servers.\nThis is used if you use the gitlab repository type.\nuse-github-api\nDefaults to true.  Similar to the no-api key on a specific repository,\nsetting use-github-api to false will define the global behavior for all\nGitHub repositories to clone the repository as it would with any other git\nrepository instead of using the GitHub API. But unlike using the git\ndriver directly, Composer will still attempt to use GitHub's zip files.\nnotify-on-install\nDefaults to true. Composer allows repositories to define a notification URL,\nso that they get notified whenever a package from that repository is installed.\nThis option allows you to disable that behavior.\ndiscard-changes\nDefaults to false and can be any of true, false or \"stash\". This option\nallows you to set the default style of handling dirty updates when in\nnon-interactive mode. true will always discard changes in vendors, while\n\"stash\" will try to stash and reapply. Use this for CI servers or deploy\nscripts if you tend to have modified vendors.\narchive-format\nDefaults to tar. Overrides the default format used by the archive command.\narchive-dir\nDefaults to .. Default destination for archives created by the archive\ncommand.\nExample:\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"archive-dir\": \"/home/user/.composer/repo\"\n    }\n}\n\nhtaccess-protect\nDefaults to true. If set to false, Composer will not create .htaccess files\nin the composer home, cache, and data directories.\nlock\nDefaults to true. If set to false, Composer will not create a composer.lock\nfile.\nplatform-check\nDefaults to php-only which only checks the PHP version. Set to true to also\ncheck the presence of extension. If set to false, Composer will not create and\nrequire a platform_check.php file as part of the autoloader bootstrap.\n← Repositories  |  Runtime →\n"},"07-runtime.html":{"url":"07-runtime.html","title":"07 Runtime","keywords":"","body":"Runtime Composer utilities\nWhile Composer is mostly used around your project to install its dependencies,\nthere are a few things which are made available to you at runtime.\nIf you need to rely on some of these in a specific version, you can require\nthe composer-runtime-api package.\nAutoload\nThe autoloader is the most used one, and is already covered in our\nbasic usage guide. It is available in all\nComposer versions.\nInstalled versions\ncomposer-runtime-api 2.0 introduced a new Composer\\InstalledVersions class which offers\na few static methods to inspect which versions are currently installed. This is\nautomatically available to your code as long as you include the Composer autoloader.\nThe main use cases for this class are the following:\nKnowing whether package X (or virtual package) is present\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::isInstalled('vendor/package'); // returns bool\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::isInstalled('psr/log-implementation'); // returns bool\n\nNote that this can not be used to check whether platform packages are installed.\nKnowing whether package X is installed in version Y\n\nNote: To use this, your package must require \"composer/semver\": \"^2.0\".\n\nuse Composer\\Semver\\VersionParser;\n\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::satisfies(new VersionParser, 'vendor/package', '2.0.*');\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::satisfies(new VersionParser, 'psr/log-implementation', '^1.0');\n\nThis will return true if e.g. vendor/package is installed in a version matching\n2.0.*, but also if the given package name is replaced or provided by some other\npackage.\nKnowing the version of package X\n\nNote: This will return null if the package name you ask for is not itself installed\nbut merely provided or replaced by another package. We therefore recommend using satisfies()\nin library code at least. In application code you have a bit more control and it is less\nimportant.\n\n// returns a normalized version (e.g. 1.2.3.0) if vendor/package is installed,\n// or null if it is provided/replaced,\n// or throws OutOfBoundsException if the package is not installed at all\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::getVersion('vendor/package');\n\n// returns the original version (e.g. v1.2.3) if vendor/package is installed,\n// or null if it is provided/replaced,\n// or throws OutOfBoundsException if the package is not installed at all\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::getPrettyVersion('vendor/package');\n\n// returns the package dist or source reference (e.g. a git commit hash) if vendor/package is installed,\n// or null if it is provided/replaced,\n// or throws OutOfBoundsException if the package is not installed at all\n\\Composer\\InstalledVersions::getReference('vendor/package');\n\nKnowing a package's own installed version\nIf you are only interested in getting a package's own version, e.g. in the source of acme/foo you want\nto know which version acme/foo is currently running to display that to the user, then it is\nacceptable to use getVersion/getPrettyVersion/getReference.\nThe warning in the section above does not apply in this case as you are sure the package is present\nand not being replaced if your code is running.\nIt is nonetheless a good idea to make sure you handle the null return value as gracefully as\npossible for safety.\n\nA few other methods are available for more complex usages, please refer to the\nsource/docblocks of the class itself.\nPlatform check\ncomposer-runtime-api 2.0 introduced a new vendor/composer/platform_check.php file, which\nis included automatically when you include the Composer autoloader.\nIt verifies that platform requirements (i.e. php and php extensions) are fulfilled\nby the PHP process currently running. If the requirements are not met, the script\nprints a warning with the missing requirements and exits with code 104.\nTo avoid an unexpected white page of death with some obscure PHP extension warning in\nproduction, you can run composer check-platform-reqs as part of your\ndeployment/build and if that returns a non-0 code you should abort.\nThe default value is php-only which only checks the PHP version.\nIf you for some reason do not want to use this safety check, and would rather\nrisk runtime errors when your code executes, you can disable this by setting the\nplatform-check config option to false.\nIf you want the check to include verifying the presence of PHP extensions,\nset the config option to true.\n← Config  |  Community →\n"},"08-community.html":{"url":"08-community.html","title":"08 Community","keywords":"","body":"Community\nThere are many people using Composer already, and quite a few of them are\ncontributing.\nContributing\nIf you would like to contribute to Composer, please read the\nREADME and\nCONTRIBUTING\ndocuments.\nThe most important guidelines are described as follows:\n\nAll code contributions - including those of people having commit access - must\ngo through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being\nmerged.
